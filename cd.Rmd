<p class="text-muted">Things to consider when writing statistical commentary.</p>


---
  
# Introduction

---

DfE publishes over 60 distinct Official Statistics collections each year, as well as numerous experimental and ad hoc releases.

The layout, structure, and length of these releases vary significantly across the Department – this is confusing for users and makes it hard to navigate across releases.

In many cases, our drafting is lengthy and overly-technical – again, this is confusing for users and out of line with best practice guidance on content design across Government.

Migration to a new statistics dissemination platform – Explore Education Statistics – presents an opportunity for us to systematically review and redesign our content to consistent and accessible standards.


---


# Why are we doing this

---

There is a clear need for clearer publications. For many of our statistics there is a big gap between public understanding and the truth of our work, and we rely too far on media and other third party organisations to interpret and present our statistics for that audience.

[GSS guidance](https://style.ons.gov.uk/category/writing-a-statistical-bulletin/){target="_blank"} sets out that **“A statistical bulletin is a short summary of findings and essential commentary related to a new release of data.” Instead, in many instances, we currently produce lengthy technical compendiums of statistics.**

Writing well and accessibly about our statistics is not a ‘nice to have’ – it is a core part of our role as producers of Official Statistics. ‘Value’ is one of the three pillars of the [Code of Practice](https://www.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/code-of-practice/the-code/){target="_blank"} and sets out how our releases should aim to **“communicate effectively with the widest possible audience [whilst presenting information] in a clear, unambiguous way that supports and promotes use by all types of users”.**

All our releases should be targeted at the ‘inquiring citizen’ type user and closer to journalistic articles than academic papers. More experienced and expert users will continue to be supported by detailed information available via publication tables and methodology documentation.

# Templates

---

The layout of the new platform provides a natural template and enforces a base level of consistency across publications, whilst leaving enough flexibility to meet the needs of a range of publications. All design aspects of this layout have been iteratively user-tested to ensure it’s as navigable, accessible, and understandable as possible.

Essentially, your release should have a headline statistics part, followed by up to 10 headered sections, most releases are already structured this way in the pdf's.

# Things to be aware of when using EES

---


## Headline facts and figures

Each release on the platform will have a summary box at the top that contains the top facts and headlines for your release – you should consider this the equivalent of the front page of what was the PDF version of your release. 

It is recommended to have 3 headline facts but you can have more or fewer. Headline facts are split into 4 elements. 

* Indicator name: Automatically generated from your data 
* Latest value:	Automatically generated from your data   
* Short outline of trend:	A short one-sentence description of the trend; try to avoid always stating the change from the previous year and talk about the longer-term trend where appropriate
* Define ‘Indicator name’: A simple description in plain English of what the indicator is  
 
You should also add a headline data block to this section, including a table and chart with the most note-worthy findings from the release. 

Use the bullet points under the key indicator tiles to pull out the top headlines from your release. Here are some top tips for writing headlines:

* When choosing headlines ask yourself: if this the most important, useful and relevant point to make? So what? What is new? 
* We recommend a maximum of six top headlines, aiming for four or five – you aren’t trying to summarise all the findings in the publication, just highlight the main points of interest
* Headlines won’t necessarily be the same every year
* Headlines should be a single sentence making a single point, be able to stand alone from the publication, and make sense to everyone (no jargon)
* Structure headlines as: what has happened; why is this important – don’t give numbers out of context 
* One of your headlines should put the latest figures in the context of the longer-term change
* Round figures in headlines – see the DfE rounding guidance
* If there is something that is absolutely essential to know for people to use the headline facts then put this here

## About these statistics

We recommend that the first accordion section in each release should be 'About these statistics'. Though do not assume that users will read it, include essential information in the section to which it refers.

What not to include in this section:

* Crucial caveats or information necessary for accurate interpretation of the statistics should be included within the main commentary next to the point they relate to
* Technical information that is not relevant to the interpretation of the statistics should be included in the methodology document
* Definitions should be included within the main commentary when they are first mentioned
* Lists or descriptions of what is in the commentary as these should be clear from the contents and accordion headings

Things you should include in this section are:

* Put the statistics in context – say why the data are collected and what they are used for or could be used for, including relevant policies and targets
* The different geographical levels for which data is published
* Non-essential but important information about the statistics, such as:
 + The data collection window, mode of data collection and response rates in terms of whether these are representative
 + Clarification of the population coverage
 + Changes in data collection or analysis methods from previous releases
* Links to relevant related statistics including the cause of any differences
* Further useful detail on specific measures used in the release
* Non-urgent notices to users such as minor error corrections and delays or changes to the next publication. If there is something important which you want all users to know about then give it its own accordion section. 


## Accordion section content

You should split your release into sections that each focus on one or two key messages, with a recommended maximum of 10 sections in the release. The whole release should take no more than 10 minutes to read.  
To keep the release short only include information if there is something interesting to say – the commentary is there to tell a story, people looking for specific figures should look in the data tablesuse the table tool, or download the underlying data instead.

Avoid having large blocks of text as they are hard to read and users scan them and miss the detail. Graphs and tables break up the content but only include these where they add value; you do not need a graph or chart in every section.

Use plain English and shorter sentences, aim for an average of 15-20 words per sentence. Do not overload sentences with numbers and avoid ‘elevator commentary’ that describes small movements in the whole series without giving any insight (use a summary table instead if it is interesting, or leave it out entirely). Be impartial and objective; avoid using sensationalist terms or terms that reflect a judgement such as “very few” “only” or “strong”. 

Explain complex concepts in plain English within the text. An example of a complex concept is a confidence interval or a significant difference.


## Active headings and titles

Active sub-headings outline the main message making them memorable for users, and can be better than a technically correct heading for letting users know what is in the rest of the section. They should be a short summary – aim for 10 words or less – rather than a full statistical headline and generally only include one number. Avoid using exaggerated or sensationalist language that you would not use in your main commentary such as “highest ever” or “only”. Be neutral in selecting the message to use in the heading rather than favouring positive messages.

Active titles are descriptive titles for charts and tables that tell the trend or highlight the main story. They should be short – aim for 10 words or less and avoid going over more than one line – rather than giving a detailed commentary on the trend or story. Active titles give users the main message without having to find the text that accompanies the chart, and makes it easier for journalists to use your chart directly without having to write their own summary. Put information such as the measure, source, population, geographical coverage and time period in a sub-heading if they are not obvious from the chart content. Add further context and information in the main text.

## Using data blocks effectively 

Presentation tables are the tables you include within the accordion sections of your release to quickly visualise numbers. These are distinct from the underlying data files, instead focusing on specific parts of the story you are telling, and should never be a copy of an underlying data file. You should only be including small tables sparingly where they add value to your release and not use them as a straight copy of the pre-canned Excel tables previously published on gov.uk. The ‘table tool’ is there for users to create their own tables if they would like to.The data is there for users to access through other means, the commentary should be focussed on the story. Aim for fewer tables, and keep them small. 
You do not need to recreate all of the old excel tables, users can find the numbers they are interested in using the table tool, or analyse the underlying data if they want the data behind the release. 
As a guide, we suggest no more than one table per accordion section.  


## Methodology

You should have an accordion section in the “help and support” section which links to the methodology document. You can use the standard text in the example below. 

It is recommended to write your methodology document as HTML on the platform. If you do not have time to do this you can upload a PDF version. If your methodology document is in PDF format you need to make sure this is accessible.

# EES Glossary

---

The glossary is intended for definitions used across multiple publications and will be maintained by HOP Office in the first instance. When you write your publication send any definitions you think need adding to the glossary to HOP Office, in plenty of time for them to be added before the publication date .

Before creating a new definition, check the glossary to see if one is already there. When creating glossary entries you should use standard DfE definitions , only write your own if it is something that relates specifically to your statistics. Do not use other technical terms in your definition, stick to plain English. 

Include essential definitions in the commentary the first time you mention them, you should not expect users to go to the glossary or about these statistics section for information they need to understand the statistics. Do not use the glossary to explain methodology such as classification decisions, explain these in the text if essential or otherwise in the methodology document.

# Design Principles and Standards

---

The following are some high-level principles to inform good content design. This are based heavily on good practice guidance across Government; in turn based on wider user research and guidance.

That said, writing good content is an art not a science – there will be legitimate reasons to depart from these principles and difference of opinions over how best to present findings to best improve understanding.

- **Length** – be brief, clear, and concise. Shorter publications are easier to read, write, and check. As crude rules of thumb our reports should aim to be no longer than around 10 pages and/or take roughly 10minutes to read.
- **Structure** – as far as possible each report should be broken down into sections – each focusing on communicating one or two key messages. As a rule of thumb these should be no longer than a page each, towards a maximum of 10 sub-sections for each report.
- **Headlines** – each report should have the 3-4 most important headline messages clearly upfront. Choose which these are and write about theme in a clear engaging way - if you glance at the report for only a few seconds this should be the information you take away.
- **Text** – avoid large blocks of text – they’re very hard to read and users end up scanning and missing all the detail anyway. Remove unnecessary content wherever possible and use headings, white space, and charts to break up text.
- **Audience** – write for the audience i.e. the general public. Explain key terms and statistical concepts, and use simple language throughout. Remember that this isn’t an update to last year’s report – this is the first time most users will be engaging with the topic.
- **Language** – use plain English and shorter sentences – aim for an average of 15-20words per sentence. Research shows that even expert users find this type of drafting preferable.
- **Quality and Methodology** – be upfront about important caveats (especially in relation to what you can and can’t conclude from the statistics) but the majority of explanatory material can be saved for supporting technical documentation. This is in line with best practice guidance to take a tiered approach to dissemination.
- **Story-telling** – add context and insight rather than just describing outputs – explain why we’re seeing the results we are if possible. As part of this, don’t include information if there isn’t anything interesting to say – giving undue prominence to information that can be left to the supporting tables in the main report is misleading and confusing for users.
- **Independence** – you are responsible for decisions around content. Views from policy colleagues, press and private offices can be weighted in these decisions as users of the statistics, but if they’re directly shaping content then that’s a breach of the Code of Practice. In some cases our outputs will give difficult messages for the Government and internal colleagues might take issue with our drafting, but our role is to present headline messages in a clear and unbiased way to inform debate appropriately.

# Style Guidance

---

We are in the process of finalising consistent style guidance – in line with GDS standards – around marginal presentational issues like, for example, choosing between %, ‘percent’ and ‘per cent’ in drafting. We will share links to this when it becomes available.

---


# Charts and Data Visualisation

---

Best practice guidance and advice on charting will be made available separately in due course.

At a high level, it’s important to think carefully about the information you’re trying to communicate. Aim to keep charts as simple and intuitive as possible to be accessible to as wide a range of users as possible – if you can’t get the key interpretation easily within a few seconds then something’s gone wrong somewhere in design.

For each summary table you also have the option of adding an accompanying chart – though you do not need to add one to every table, you should use charts where they complement the story you are trying to tell. 
Only use complex charts where there is a clear user need, as simple charts are the easiest for users to understand. Where there is a need for a chart which cannot be produced using the chart builder you should follow these guidelines:
INSERT GUIDELINES HERE including RGB colour codes, font types and sizes, placement of legends and axis labels

# Advice and Support

---

There are no hard rules to follow on content design and the layout of individual statistics releases won’t be policed centrally. It’s ultimately a matter of judgement for individuals to ensure your statistics are as accessible and understandable as possible. There’s no rules.

We’re all well-practiced at breaking complex results down into simple messages whether it’s for inducting new starters, providing briefing for new Ministers, or explaining our work for friends and family – we just need to apply the same standards to our headline reporting.

For those looking for more targeted advice and support there’s a DfE Content Design Champions Group and we’re considering options around offering direct feedback and scrum sessions to review publications if there’s sufficient demand. Contact John Shale in the first instance for any advice.

More detailed advice and guidance on good content design is available from a number of resources across Government and beyond.

- Similarly, the [Hemingway app](http://www.hemingwayapp.com/) is an online tool to assess readability. Whilst we might not want to use this directly for final drafting, it is useful to highlight areas of particular complexity in our current narrative. Relatedly, the GSS Good Practice team set an exercise to try to write about your results without using any numbers – this can be really helpful to help understand the story you’re trying to tell with your statistics.

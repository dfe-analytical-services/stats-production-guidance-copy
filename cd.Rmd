<p class="text-muted">Things to consider when writing statistical commentary.</p>


---
  
# Introduction

---

DfE publishes over 60 distinct Official Statistics collections each year, as well as numerous experimental and ad hoc releases.

The layout, structure, and length of these releases vary significantly across the Department – this is confusing for users and makes it hard to navigate across releases.

In many cases, our drafting is lengthy and overly-technical – again, this is confusing for users and out of line with best practice guidance on content design across Government.

Migration to a new statistics dissemination platform – Explore Education Statistics – presents an opportunity for us to systematically review and redesign our content to consistent and accessible standards.


---


# Why this is important

---

There is a clear need for clearer publications. For many of our statistics there is a big gap between public understanding and the truth of our work, and we rely too far on media and other third party organisations to interpret and present our statistics for that audience.

[GSS guidance](https://style.ons.gov.uk/category/writing-a-statistical-bulletin/){target="_blank"} sets out that **“A statistical bulletin is a short summary of findings and essential commentary related to a new release of data.” Instead, in many instances, we currently produce lengthy technical compendiums of statistics.**

Writing well and accessibly about our statistics is not a ‘nice to have’ – it is a core part of our role as producers of Official Statistics. ‘Value’ is one of the three pillars of the [Code of Practice](https://www.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/code-of-practice/the-code/){target="_blank"} and sets out how our releases should aim to **“communicate effectively with the widest possible audience [whilst presenting information] in a clear, unambiguous way that supports and promotes use by all types of users”.**

All our releases should be targeted at the ‘inquiring citizen’ type user and closer to journalistic articles than academic papers. More experienced and expert users will continue to be supported by detailed information available via publication tables and methodology documentation.

---


# Structure within EES

---

The layout of the new platform provides a natural template and enforces a base level of consistency, whilst leaving enough flexibility to meet the needs of a range of publications. All design aspects of this layout have been iteratively user-tested to ensure it’s as navigable, accessible, and understandable as possible. 

Essentially, your release should have a headline statistics part, followed by up to 10 headered accordion sections, most releases are already structured this way in the PDFs.

<div class="alert alert-dismissible alert-info">
Word templates for drafting the commentary, and for creating PDFs for the external metadata and pre-release-access list are saved on [sharepoint](https://educationgovuk.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/sites/DfEStatisticsCoherence/Shared%20Documents/Templates%20-%20Explore%20Education%20Statistics?csf=1&e=qPdc7s){target="_blank"}.
</div>

---


## Headline facts and figures

---

Each release on the platform will have a summary box at the top that contains the top facts and headlines for your release – you should consider this the equivalent of the front page of what was the PDF version of your release. 

It is recommended to have 3 headline statistics but you can have more or fewer. Key statistic tiles are split into the following elements. 

`r knitr::include_graphics("images/key-stat.PNG")`

| Element | Content |
|---------|---------|
| Indicator name | Automatically generated from your data | 
| Latest value | Automatically generated from your data |
| Trend | A short one-sentence description of the trend; try to avoid only stating the change from the previous year and talk about the longer-term trend where appropriate |
| Guidance title | Should be set to 'What is this?' |
| Guidance text | A simple description in plain English of what the indicator is |
 
 
<div class="alert alert-dismissible alert-info">
You should also add a headline data block to this section, including a table and chart with the most note-worthy findings from the release. 
</div>

Use bullet points under the key indicator tiles to pull out the top headlines from your release. Here are some top tips for writing headlines:

* Ask yourself if this is the most important, useful and relevant point to make? Why? What is new? 
* We recommend a maximum of six top headlines, aiming for four or five
* You shouldn't be trying to summarise all the findings in the publication
* Headlines won’t necessarily be the same every year
* Headlines should be a single sentence making a single point, and be able to stand alone from the publication
* Headlines should make sense to everyone and anyone (no jargon)
* Structure headlines as: what has happened; why is this important – don’t give numbers without context 
* One of your headlines should put the latest figures in the context of the longer-term change
* Round figures in headlines, you don't need lots of decimal places
* If there is essential context for the headline facts then put this here

---

## About these statistics

---

We recommend that the first accordion section in each release should be 'About these statistics'. Do not assume that users will read it, the nature of interactive pages means that the reader may start at any accordion section so remember to include essential information in the section to which it refers.

---

#### What not to include in this section:

---

* Crucial caveats or information necessary for accurate interpretation of the statistics, these should be included within the main commentary next to the point they relate to
* Technical information that is not relevant to the interpretation of the statistics should be saved for the methodology
* Definitions should be included within the main commentary when they are first mentioned
* Lists or descriptions of what is in the commentary as these should be clear from the contents and accordion headings

---

#### Things that you should include in this section are:

---

* Say why the data are collected and what they are used for or could be used for, including relevant policies and targets
* The different geographical levels for which data is published
* Non-essential but important information about the statistics, such as:
   + The data collection window, mode of data collection and response rates in terms of whether these are representative
   + Clarification of the population coverage
   + Changes in data collection or analysis methods from previous releases
* Links to relevant related statistics including the cause of any differences
* Further useful detail on specific measures used in the release
* Non-urgent notices to users such as minor error corrections and delays or changes to the next publication. If there is something important which you want all users to know about then give it its own accordion section. 

---

## Accordion section content

---

You should split your release into sections that each focus on one or two key messages, with a recommended maximum of 10 sections in the release. **The whole release should take no more than 10 minutes to read.**  

To keep the release short only include information if there is something interesting to say – the commentary is there to tell a story, people looking for specific figures will use the table tool, or download the underlying data instead. **Do not try to summarise every number in the commentary.**

Avoid having large blocks of text as they are hard to read and users scan them and miss the detail. Graphs and tables break up the content but only include these where they add value; **you do not need a graph or chart in every section.**

Use plain English and shorter sentences, aim for an average of 15-20 words per sentence. Do not overload sentences with numbers and avoid ‘elevator commentary’ that describes small movements in the whole series without giving any insight (use a summary table instead if it is interesting, or leave it out entirely). **Be impartial and objective; avoid using sensationalist terms or terms that reflect a judgement such as “very few” “only” or “strong”.**

Explain complex concepts in plain English within the text. Remember that for many of our users, confidence intervals and significant differences are complex concepts that need explaining.

---

## Active headings and titles

---

Throughout the commentary, active sub-headings outline the main messages making them memorable for users. They should be a short summary of the contents – **aim for 10 words or less** – rather than a full statistical headline. **Avoid using exaggerated or sensationalist language** that you would not use in your main commentary such as “highest ever” or “only”. Be neutral in selecting the message to use in the heading rather than favouring positive or negative messages.

For tables and charts, active titles are descriptive and tell the trend by **highlighting the main story**. They should be short – aim for 10 words or less and avoid going over more than one line. Active titles give users the main message without having to find the text that accompanies the chart, and makes it easier for journalists to use your chart directly without having to write their own summary. 

Put information such as the measure, source, population, geographical coverage and time period in a caption if they are not obvious from the chart content. Add further context and information in the main text. **Remember that tables and charts should be usable even if isolated** from the rest of the release.

---

## Using data blocks effectively 

---

**Aim for fewer tables, and keep them small. As a guide, we suggest no more than one table per accordion section.**

Presentation tables are the tables you include within the accordion sections of your release to quickly visualise numbers. Unlike the underlying data files, the presentation tables focus on specific parts of the story you are telling. They are distinct from, and should never be a copy of an underlying data file. 

You should only be including small tables sparingly where they add value to your release and not use them as a straight copy of the ready-made Excel tables previously published on gov.uk. The data itself is there for users to access through other means, therefore any data in the commentary should only be there if it is enhancing the story.

<div class="alert alert-dismissible alert-danger">
You do not need to recreate all of the old excel tables, users can find the numbers they are interested in using the table tool, or analyse the underlying data if they want the data behind the release. 
</div>

---

## Methodology

---

Appropriate methodological information should be made available for all published Official Statistics releases. 

You are able to create these methodology documents within the Explore Education Statistics platform and then can attach them to relevant releases. 

It is recommended that you write your methodology document as a .html page on the platform. If you do not have time to do this, you can either contact us to help you with that, or you can upload a PDF version. If you are uploading a pdf version then you need to make sure this is accessible.

For releases that have a .html methodology page the relevant link will display as an accordion section under the “help and support” section.

# EES glossary

---

The [glossary in Explore Education Statistics](https://explore-education-statistics.service.gov.uk/glossary){target="_blank"} is intended for definitions used across multiple publications and will be maintained by HoP Office in the first instance. When you write your publication send any definitions you think need adding to the glossary to [HoP Office](mailto:Hop.STATISTICS@education.gov.uk), in plenty of time for them to be added before the publication date .

Before creating a new definition, check the glossary to see if one is already there. When creating glossary entries you should use standard DfE definitions, only write your own if it is something that relates specifically to your statistics. Do not use technical terms in your definition, stick to plain English. 

Include essential definitions in the commentary where they are relevant, you should not expect users to go to the glossary or about these statistics section for information they need to understand the statistics. Do not use the glossary to explain methodology such as classification decisions, explain these in the text if essential or otherwise in the methodology document.

# Content principles and standards

---

The following are some high-level principles to inform good content design. These are based on best practice guidance across Government; and in turn based on wider user research and guidance in this area.



| Principle      | Checklist for content                                        | Why this is important                               |        
|-------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| Length  | Is it brief, clear and concise? Does it take <10 minutes to read?    | Shorter publications are easier to read, write, and check |
| Structure     | Is it broken into sections focusing on one or two key messages each? Are sections less than one page long? Are there 10 or less sub-sections? | Well-structured content is easier for the reader to navigate and draw out key messages|
| Headlines     | Are there 3-4 headline messages up front? Are they written in a clear and engaging way?| Users should be able to get the key information within only seconds of looking at the report|
| Text     | Are there no large blocks of text? Has someone else reviewed to remove unnecessary content? | Large blocks of text are hard for the reader to digest|
| Audience     | Could a member of the general public understand this? Are key terms and statistical concepts explained? | The general public are the key users of our statistics. This may be the first time they are engaging with the topic|
| Language     | Is this written in plain English? Are sentences an average of 15-20 words long?| Research shows that even expert users find short and simple sentences preferable|
| Quality and Methodology     | Are you upfront about important caveats, especially in relation to what you can and can't conclude from the statistics? Is the majority of explanatory material in the supporting documentation?| Users need to be aware of the limitations of the data, but not overwhelmed with information in the main text. Take a tiered approach to dissemination |
| Story-telling     | Does it add context and insight rather than just describing the outputs? Does it explain why we see the results if possible?  | Including numbers without reason overwhelms and confuses users|
| Independence     | Have you presented headline messages in a clear and unbiased way to inform debate appropriately?| You are responsible for decisions around content. Views from policy colleagues, press and private offices can be weighted in these decisions as users of the statistics, but if they’re directly shaping content then that’s a breach of the [Code of Practice](https://www.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/code-of-practice/){target="_blank"}. In some cases our outputs will give difficult messages for the Government and internal colleagues might take issue with our drafting|

# Style guidance

---

<div class="alert alert-dismissible alert-info">
We are in the process of finalising consistent style guidance – in line with GDS standards – around marginal presentational issues like, for example, choosing between %, ‘percent’ and ‘per cent’ in drafting. We will share links to this when it becomes available.


If you have any particular things you would like to see in this, please contact us.
</div>

# Charts and data visualisation

---

Only use complex charts where there is a clear user need, as simple charts are the easiest for users to understand. It’s important to think carefully about the information you’re trying to communicate. Aim to keep charts as simple and intuitive as possible to be accessible to all users – if you can’t get the key interpretation easily within a few seconds then something’s gone wrong somewhere in design.

Remember that visualisations should be useable even if taken out of the context of the release. You have the option of adding an accompanying chart for each table included in the release – you do not need to add one to every table, you should only use charts where they add value to the story you are trying to tell. 

If needed, you can use the 'upload an infographic as an alternative' option to upload images of charts you have produced outside of the service. This should only be used where a chart cannot be made in EES. It is expected that teams use the EES chart builder where possible. If you have feedback on any functionality that you would like adding to the chart builder, please let us know.

<div class="alert alert-dismissible alert-info">
DfE specific best practice guidance and advice on visualisations will be added here in due course. In the meantime, here is the latest GSS-wide [guidance on visualising data](https://gss.civilservice.gov.uk/policy-store/introduction-to-data-visualisation/){target="_blank"}.
</div>

# Peer review
<!-- keep this heading the same on this page, even if moved, as the self-assessment tool links from it -->

---

Peer review is an important element of quality assuring our work. We often do it without realising by bouncing ideas off of one another and by getting others to 'idiot check' our work. When writing content, ensuring that we get our work formally peer reviewed is particularly important for ensuring it's clarity and value. Can others easily understand what you've written? Does it all feel important and worth writing about to them? 
More will follow in this space, though in the meantime please contact us if you're interested in having your content peer reviewed.

---


# Advice and support

---

There are no hard rules to follow on content design and the layout of individual statistics releases will vary. Publication teams have the power to use the above guidance to ensure your statistics are as accessible and understandable as possible.

We’re all well-practiced at breaking complex results down into simple messages whether it’s for inducting new starters, providing briefing for new Ministers, or explaining our work for friends and family – we just need to apply the same standards to our headline reporting.

For those looking for more targeted advice and support there’s a DfE Content Design Champions Group and we’re open to offering direct feedback and scrum sessions to review publications if there’s sufficient demand. Contact the [Statistics Development Team](mailto:explore.statistics@education.gov.uk) if you're interested in these or would like any advice.

More detailed advice and guidance on content design best practice is available from a number of resources across Government and beyond:

- [GSS best practice guidance](https://gss.civilservice.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Writing-about-statistics-Edition-2.0-October-2018-1.pdf){target="_blank"}
- [GSS best practice hints and tips](https://teams.microsoft.com/_){target="_blank"}
- [ONS style guide](https://style.ons.gov.uk/category/writing-a-statistical-bulletin/){target="_blank"}
- [UNECE drafting guidance](http://www.unece.org/stats/documents/writing.html){target="_blank"}
- [This link](https://support.office.com/en-gb/article/test-your-document-s-readability-85b4969e-e80a-4777-8dd3-f7fc3c8b3fd2){target="_blank"} provides details on how to get readability scores on your drafting in Word.
- Similarly, the [Hemingway app](http://www.hemingwayapp.com/) is an online tool to assess readability. Whilst we might not want to use this directly for final drafting, it is useful to highlight areas of particular complexity in our current narrative. Relatedly, the GSS Good Practice team set an exercise to try to write about your results without using any numbers – this can be really helpful to help understand the story you’re trying to tell with your statistics.
- As an illustrative example of work in other Departments – DWP’s Fraud & Error statistics [before](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/fraud-and-error-in-the-benefit-system-201213-estimates){target="_blank"} (128 page release), and [after](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/fraud-and-error-in-the-benefit-system-financial-year-2017-to-2018-estimates){target="_blank"} their own modernisation work are worth a look.

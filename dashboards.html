Guidance for publishing Official statistics dashboards
</p>
<hr />
<div id="when-to-use-a-dashboard" class="section level1">
<h1>When to use a dashboard</h1>
<hr />
<p>The primary route for publishing official statistics is via <a href="https://explore-education-statistics.service.gov.uk/">Explore Education Statistics</a> (EES). In addition to publishing on EES, there may be times where you want to compliment official statistics with a dashboard. This may be to do a deeper piece of analysis for a specific user group, or to make use of functionality that isn’t available within the platform.</p>
<p>It is important that all dashboards should have a clear use case and reasoning for why they are required. If you are considering developing and publishing a dashboard, please get in touch with the <a href="mailto:statistics.development@education.gov.uk">Statistics Development Team</a> who can advise and assist with the process, and make use of the <a href="https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3a35fa27cbced34928a3609e41510057e5%40thread.skype/R-Shiny%2520Statistics%2520Dashboards?groupId=679b2376-8c8c-4062-a1c9-0744ce5ac88f&amp;tenantId=fad277c9-c60a-4da1-b5f3-b3b8b34a82f9">teams channel</a> to ask questions and share what you’re working on with other teams.</p>
<p>This guidance is aimed primarily at dashboards published to supplement Official Statistics to the wider public. See the <a href="#how-to-publish-an-r-shiny-dashboard">how to publish an R shiny dashboard</a> section below for more information on the guidance for internal only R Shiny dashboards, or public facing R Shiny dashboards via shinyapps.io.</p>
<p>This page includes specific guidance for R Shiny dashboards, for teams using PowerBI, the department has a set of PowerBI dashboard standards that can be found on the <a href="https://dfe-analytical-services.github.io/powerbi_dashboardstandards/">DfE’s analytical services GitHub area</a>.</p>
<p>There is also a dashboards version of the content design checklist. This checklist runs through a number of things to think about when developing dashboards to compliment official statistics and is worth using to design and also review any dashboards you own - <a href="resources/Content_Design_Logbook_Dashboards.xlsx">Dashboards checklist (.xlsx)</a>. We also have a <a href="#dashboard-procedure-checklist">dashboard procedure checklist</a> in this guidance page that outlines the steps required to set up an R shiny dashboard.</p>
<hr />
</div>
<div id="things-to-consider" class="section level1">
<h1>Things to consider</h1>
<hr />
<p>All dashboards should have a clear use case and reasoning for why they are required. They also need to meet the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/helping-people-to-use-your-service/understanding-wcag">latest accessibility regulations</a> for public sector services.</p>
<p>Dashboards, along with the Official Statistics that they supplement, are a digital service that we provide, and we should ensure we follow the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-standard">Service Standard</a>. The standard covers a number of aspects that all producers should be considering when developing a dashboard, and strongly influence the guidance on this page.</p>
<p>All data must be published on EES as open CSV files so that it is accessible in one place and we are not publishing anything new via dashboards.</p>
<p>When published, dashboards can be directed to from existing EES releases using the related links at the top right of a release page, or by being included as a url anywhere in the release content.</p>
<p>The following sections cover the considerations in more detail, though when developing a dashboard you need to commit to thinking about:</p>
<ul>
<li>User needs</li>
<li>Software - long term sustainability, knowledge and resource</li>
<li>Accessibility guidance</li>
<li>Consistent styling</li>
<li>User engagement and analytics</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<div id="user-needs" class="section level2">
<h2>User needs</h2>
<hr />
<p>When designing a government service, always start by learning about the people who will use it. If you do not understand who they are or what they need from your service, you cannot build the right thing.</p>
<p>Understanding as much of the context as possible gives you the best chance of meeting users’ needs in a simple and cost effective way.</p>
<p>The real problem might not be the one you originally thought needed solving. Testing your assumptions early and often reduces the risk of building the wrong thing.</p>
<p>Services designed around users and their needs:</p>
<ul>
<li>are more likely to be used</li>
<li>help more people get the right outcome for them - and so achieve their policy intent</li>
<li>cost less to operate by reducing time and money spent on resolving problems</li>
</ul>
<p>See the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/user-research/start-by-learning-user-needs">service manual</a> for more information on learning about your users and their needs.</p>
<hr />
</div>
<div id="tools-software" class="section level2">
<h2>Tools / software</h2>
<hr />
<p>When you make a decision about technology, you’re making a significant investment. The choices you make will have a huge impact on your ability to create, iterate and operate the service in a sustainable way. We should be choosing tools and technology that let us create a high quality service in a cost effective way and minimise the cost of changing direction in future.</p>
<p>The most common dashboard options available to us are:</p>
<ul>
<li>R Shiny</li>
<li>Python Dash (or other Python-based alternatives)</li>
<li>PowerBI</li>
</ul>
<p>Some considerations to think about when choosing the tooling / software for a dashboard:</p>
<ul>
<li>will it be open source? (Service standards <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-standard/point-12-make-new-source-code-open">12</a> and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-standard/point-13-use-common-standards-components-patterns">13</a>)</li>
<li>what skills do your team already have, or are already developing?</li>
<li>can you reuse anything that someone else has already done?</li>
<li>do you have flexibility in formatting and styling?</li>
<li>will you be able to maintain it long term?</li>
<li>does it give the flexibility required to meet accessibility requirements?</li>
<li>what costs will it involve? (Consider learning and development time and courses as well as hosting)</li>
<li>will it allow you to develop automated testing and CI to QA our dashboards?</li>
<li>does it align with the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/af-learning-curriculum-technical">AF expectation</a> to move towards R and Python for analysis?</li>
</ul>
<p>For statistics production teams we’d recommended using R Shiny. We feel that it best meets the service standards, it aligns with the departments RAP strategy for the use of R in in Official Statistics, and the general direction of the government analytical community. It takes advantage of transferable knowledge and shared resources to minimise the costs and maximise the shared benefits.</p>
<p>While we recommend R Shiny, teams can use other tools as long as you can justify it against Service Standard <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-standard/point-11-choose-the-right-tools-and-technology">11. Choose the right tools and technology</a>.</p>
<p>The guidance on this page will focus on R Shiny. However, if you are using PowerBI you should also make use of the department’s <a href="https://dfe-analytical-services.github.io/powerbi_dashboardstandards/">PowerBI Dashboard standards</a>, and aim to make use of reusable configurations where possible to ensure that duplication of effort across the department is minimised.</p>
<hr />
</div>
<div id="accessibility" class="section level2">
<h2>Accessibility</h2>
<hr />
<p>Government services must work for everyone who needs to use them. Public sector organisations have a legal duty to consider everyone’s needs when they’re designing and delivering services. Making a website or mobile app accessible means making sure it can be used by as many people as possible. This includes those with:</p>
<ul>
<li>impaired vision</li>
<li>motor difficulties</li>
<li>cognitive impairments or learning disabilities</li>
<li>deafness or impaired hearing</li>
</ul>
<p>Accessibility means more than putting things online. It means making your content and design clear and simple enough so that most people can use it without needing to adapt it, while supporting those who do need to adapt things.</p>
<p>The accessibility regulations came into force for public sector bodies on 23 September 2018. They say you must make your website or mobile app more accessible by making it ‘perceivable, operable, understandable and robust’. The full name of the accessibility regulations is the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018. The accessibility regulations build on your existing obligations to people who have a disability under the Equality Act 2010 (or the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 in Northern Ireland).</p>
<p>These regulations apply to all dashboards created for Official statistics. All dashboards should:</p>
<ul>
<li>have an <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/make-your-website-or-app-accessible-and-publish-an-accessibility-statement#publish-your-accessibility-statement">accessibility statement</a></li>
<li>follow the <a href="#accessibility-testing">guidance below</a> for testing against <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/helping-people-to-use-your-service/understanding-wcag">WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standard</a></li>
<li>use open data that is already available via EES</li>
</ul>
<p>Analysts should familiarise themselves with the gov.uk guidance on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/helping-people-to-use-your-service/making-your-service-accessible-an-introduction#meeting-government-accessibility-requirements">service accessibility</a></p>
<hr />
</div>
<div id="governance" class="section level2">
<h2>Governance</h2>
<hr />
<p>All teams developing dashboards to accompany Official Statistics should contact the <a href="mailto:statistics.development@education.gov.uk">Statistics Development Team</a> for advice on the level of approval required as there may be times when HoP approval is needed in addition to team/unit leader approval. Approvals should be sent to the Statistics Development Team when asking for a new dashboard to be hosted on shinyapps.io.</p>
<p>The standards for dashboards, and department strategy are maintained by the Central Statistics Standards Unit and governed by the Statistics Leadership Group, which is made up of all senior statisticians owning Official Statistics publications in the department.</p>
<p>Regular reflection on how teams are doing and finding ways to improve is an important part of good governance. We recommend that Senior Statisticians responsible for dashboards ensure that they are regularly reviewed, covering:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#code-testing">testing and quality assurance</a></li>
<li><a href="#accessibility">accessibility</a></li>
<li><a href="#assessing-performance">performance against user needs</a></li>
<li>overall coherence with central standards and strategy found on this page</li>
</ul>
<hr />
</div>
<div id="iterative-development" class="section level2">
<h2>Iterative development</h2>
<hr />
<p>Using <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery">agile</a> methods means getting your service in front of real users as soon as possible. Then observing and generating data on how they use it and iterating the service based on what you’ve learned. Because you’re not specifying everything up front before you’ve developed an understanding of what users need, agile methods reduce the risk of delivering the wrong thing.</p>
<p>Teams should aim to get a working version of their dashboard out to users as soon as possible to prototype the design and content.</p>
<p>Iteration isn’t just for the early stages of a service’s development and services are never ‘finished’. Using agile methods means getting real people using your service as early as possible. Then making improvements throughout the lifetime of the service.</p>
<p>Making improvements means more than doing basic maintenance like fixing bugs in code, deploying security patches and keeping call centre scripts up to date. If that’s all you do, you’ll be fixing symptoms rather than underlying problems. And over time, the service will stop meeting user needs.</p>
<p>Continuous improvement means you can respond to changes in user needs, technology or government policy throughout the lifetime of the service. So rather than having to be replaced, the service stays relevant until it’s ready to be retired.</p>
<hr />
</div>
<div id="code-testing" class="section level2">
<h2>Code testing</h2>
<hr />
<p>Testing is a way to capture desired behaviour of your code, in such a way that you can automatically verify that it keeps working the way you expect over time. It is essential for making sure that code works the way that you intend it to, and keeps working even after you make changes to the code so that your users have access to a stable service. You need to test your service regularly as part of quality assurance (QA) to make sure that it:</p>
<ul>
<li>is easy to use for anyone who needs to use it, regardless of the device they’re using</li>
<li>is stable, secure and works quickly, regardless of how many people need to use it</li>
<li>can be iterated quickly to meet changes to user needs or the political environment</li>
</ul>
<p>Tests can come in a variety of shapes and sizes, good starting points for analysts new to testing are the <a href="https://best-practice-and-impact.github.io/qa-of-code-guidance/testing_code.html">Duck Book</a>, and <a href="https://dfe-analytical-services.github.io/good-code-practice/testing.html">DfE good code practice</a>.</p>
<p>You should aim to automate as much of your testing as possible and run your test suite as part of continuous integration (where your tests form part of your codebase). By testing your code automatically every time you make a change, you’ll be able to find defects more quickly. Getting fast feedback means you can respond to any problems quickly and make changes when you need to. You can also spot defects before they develop into bigger problems that are more complicated and expensive to fix.</p>
<p>For dashboards created in R Shiny, we strongly recommend a mix of unit tests and UI tests (integration), run using GitHub Actions for continuous integration (CI). All applications should have an appropriate level of test coverage before being published. More information and details on how to get started with this can be found in the <a href="#testing-r-shiny">testing R Shiny</a> section below.</p>

<div id="assessing-engagement" class="section level2">
<h2>Assessing engagement</h2>
<hr />
<p>Work out what success looks like for your service and identify metrics which will tell you what’s working and what can be improved, combined with user research. For dashboards this will likely be things like the number of users and interactions with what you have created.</p>
<p>Defining what “good” looks like and identifying appropriate metrics means that you’ll know whether the service is solving the problem that it’s meant to solve.</p>
<p>Collecting the right engagement data means you’ll be alerted to potential problems with your service. And when you make a change to the service, you’ll be able to tell whether it had the effect you expected. In practice this will often mean setting up analytics and feedback surveys for dashboards and monitoring the data you get back.</p>
<p>At a minumum you should be requesting feedback from users via a survey hosted on the dashboard and reviewing this on a regular basis. An example of this kind of feedback survey is the <a href="https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=yXfS-grGoU2187O4s0qC-XMiKzsnr8xJoWM_DeGwIu9UNDJHOEJDRklTNVA1SDdLOFJITEwyWU1OQS4u">beta banner survey</a> on Explore Education Statistics.</p>

<p>Google Analytics is a free service that collects information on who visits your webpage and how they interact with it. You can set up basic Google Analytics for your published dashboard in a few simple steps outlined in this article: <a href="https://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/google-analytics.html">Add Google Analytics to a Shiny app</a> and view a more complex example in this <a href="https://github.com/dfe-analytical-services/exclusion-statistics/blob/master/www/google-analytics.js">example file</a>.

<div id="peer-review" class="section level2">
<h2>Peer review</h2>
<hr />
<p>Peer review is a quality assurance activity, where an analyst other than the original author, views and tests the usage of a product or specific piece of code. This allows a fresh pair of eyes to take a look at your work. It validates that you have taken a correct approach and may highlight errors. This constructive feedback helps you to improve the quality. It provides confidence in your work, and ensures that it is fit for purpose.</p>
<ul>
<li>Dashboards must always be peer reviewed within the team they are created.</li>
<li>Dashboards should also be peer reviewed by analysts outside of the subject area of the team.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Central Statistics Unit has a number of analysts experience with R Shiny dashboards and are happy to review any dashboards created, contact <a href="mailto:statistcs.development@education.gov.uk" class="email">statistcs.development@education.gov.uk</a> if you’re interested in this. For more guidance on how to peer review, see the <a href="https://best-practice-and-impact.github.io/qa-of-code-guidance/peer_review.html">peer review section of the Duck Book</a>.</p>

<h1>How to publish an R Shiny dashboard</h1>
<hr />
<p>How you choose to publish your R Shiny application will depend on the type of access you require for it.</p>
<hr />
<div id="internal-only-dashboards" class="section level2">
<h2>Internal only dashboards</h2>
<hr />
<p>It’s possible to publish dashboards that are only accessible to those on DfE kit, to do this you will need to publish via the departments RSConnect servers.</p>
<p>You will need:</p>
<ul>
<li>A finished app, in line with the guidance on this page</li>
<li>The code to be in a Git repository in the dfe-gov-uk Azure DevOps space</li>
</ul>
<p>To publish the app, you’ll need to set up a pipeline in Azure DevOps, guidance for how to do this can be found in the <a href="https://teams.microsoft.com/l/team/19%3a311ec2e4d46b4dd38f0d61f05fb93383%40thread.skype/conversations?groupId=b95c605d-8fbc-4e4d-9a76-2f7d1c55e70a&amp;tenantId=fad277c9-c60a-4da1-b5f3-b3b8b34a82f9">R community teams area</a>.</p>
<p>Access to applications on RSConnect are locked down by default, once the pipeline is set up and you’ve deployed the app you’ll need to request for its access to be opened up by using an RSConnect request on <a href="https://dfe.service-now.com/serviceportal?id=sc_cat_item&amp;sys_id=1e3c3cb9db80ab003b929334ca9619df&amp;sysparm_category=09e18be6db2f8340865049ee3b96190f">ServiceNow</a>.</p>
<p>If you’re running the app from an internal database, you’ll need to contact the database owner to set up a local login, and then store those as variables against your specific app in rsconnect. You can raise a request to do this via <a href="https://dfe.service-now.com/serviceportal?id=sc_cat_item&amp;sys_id=1e3c3cb9db80ab003b929334ca9619df&amp;sysparm_category=09e18be6db2f8340865049ee3b96190f">ServiceNow</a> and selecting ‘Change app variables’.</p>

<div id="public-dashboards" class="section level2">
<h2>Public dashboards</h2>
<hr />
<p>The majority of dashboards made to support and augment our Official Statistics will be public facing. For public facing shiny apps you should publish via shinyapps.io. The statistics development team manage a subscription for this and can help you get set up.</p>
<p>You will need:</p>
<ul>
<li>A finished app that meets the accessibility and styling standards (see our <a href="#dashboard-procedure-checklist">Dashboard procedure checklist</a>)</li>
<li>Code in the dfe-analytical-services GitHub repo</li>
<li>Approval from your DD</li>
<li>If the data underlying the dashboard is currently unpublished, you will need to create dummy data to use in GitHub until the data becomes published (see <a href="#dummy-data">dummy data guidance</a> section).</li>
</ul>
<p>To set up a new app, send the above to <a href="mailto:statistics.development@education.gov.uk" class="email">statistics.development@education.gov.uk</a>. If your code is not yet hosted in the dfe-analytical-services area you can request for the repository to be moved at the same time as sending approvals.</p>
<hr />
<div id="dummy-data" class="section level3">
<h3>Dummy data</h3>
<hr />
<p>When creating a public dashboard, all code and data will be hosted in the dfe-analytical-services GitHub repo. This is a public repo, meaning anything stored in here is publicly available. Therefore if you are creating a dashboard with previously unpublished data, you should provide dummy data for the GitHub repo, and only add the real data on your publication date.</p>
<p>Your dummy data should:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use the exact same structure and variable names as your real data</li>
<li>Use random values in place of real values (one example of how to do this is using the <code>rnorm()</code> function)</li>
<li>Simulate the types of suppression, missing data or anomalies seen in your real data, to ensure the dashboard can account for these.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
</div>
<div id="testing-with-unpublished-data" class="section level3">
<h3>Testing with unpublished data</h3>
<hr />
<p>While you must use <a href="#dummy-data">dummy data</a> in your GitHub repo, it is understandable that we should test the dashboard works with the real data before it goes live.</p>
<p>This can be done using the .gitignore file alongside the datafiles_log.csv and commit hooks explained in the <a href="#stopping-accidental-data-uploads">Stopping accidental data uploads guidance</a>. You can view the example files our <a href="https://github.com/dfe-analytical-services/shiny-template">template repository</a>.</p>
<p>The .gitignore file is a plain text file that tells git to ignore specified files in commits and pushes to the repo. Therefore, the first step when wanting to test unpublished data in a dashboard is to add the unpublished data file names to the .gitignore file.</p>
<p>Adding the file name alone will ensure it is ignored no matter where in the project area you save it (i.e. in any folder). Once this is done, you can add your unpublished data file to your local area, run the app locally, and make edits/commits without uploading the data to Github.</p>
<p>This <a href="https://linuxize.com/post/gitignore-ignoring-files-in-git/#:~:text=.gitignore%20is%20a%20plain%20text%20file%20in%20which,a%20single%20backslash%20%28%29%20to%20escape%20the%20character.">.GitIgnore guidance page</a> has great guidance on how you can utilize wildcards to capture all the files you might want to ignore.</p>

<div id="dashboard-procedure-checklist" class="section level3">
<h3>Dashboard procedure checklist</h3>
<hr />
<p>This checklist outlines the standard procedure for teams who are wishing to produce a public R shiny dashboard.</p>
<p>Getting set up:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create an account on <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a></li>
<li>Ask the <a href="mailto:statistics.development@education.gov.uk">Statistics Deveopment Team</a> to create you a repository in the <a href="https://github.com/dfe-analytical-services">DfE analytical services area</a>, providing the name of the dashboard and the GitHub accounts of anyone who will be contributing to the code. You should aim to have two analysts working on the code development and a line manager for review purposes. Further colleagues with review responsibilities (policy colleagues, G6 and above, etc.) can be given access to a demo-site, rather than the repository (see guidance for this below in ‘Setting up a development/demo dashboard area’).</li>
<li>Clone the repo to your device so you can develop your code. Open the repo page in GitHub, click the green ‘Code’ button, and copy the URL it provides. Then, open R Studio on your device, click file &gt; new project &gt; version control &gt; git, paste the repository URL you copied from GitHub, give your local project area a name, and choose where to save it (i.e. on your computer’s C: drive, outside of the OneDrive-synced folders).</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you’re set up, there are certain parts of the code you need to update:</p>
<ul>
<li>In the global.R script, update all of the site URL’s and EES publication names to your own.</li>
<li>In the ui.R script, update the tags$title(), the information in the meta_general(), and the secondary text in shinyGovstyle::header().</li>
<li>Got to the .github &gt; workflows folder, and open the deploy-shiny.yaml file. At the bottom, update the appName in rsconnect::deployApp() - this is what will appear in the URLs (i.e. must align with the links in global).</li>
<li>Update the ‘Support and feedback’ tab (in R &gt; standard_panels.R) with your teams information. We also recommend creating a feedback form for users of your dashboard, and adding a link to that on this page.</li>
<li>Update the README.md file (you can do this easily directly in GitHub). This is the file that renders below your repo in GitHub for users to see.</li>
<li>Begin adding your own dashboard content. If you copy and paste any parts of the code (i.e. to create new tabs) you must change all of the IDs so there are no repeated IDs in the UI, otherwise the app will run with no UI elements. You should add UI and unit tests as you develop your code as a form of automated QA (see our <a href="#ui-tests">guidance on UI tests</a> and <a href="#unit-tests">guidance on unit tests</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p>You must contact the statistics development team for the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>To add the shinyapps.io secret and token to your GitHub repo, therefore enabling the app to be hosted on shinyapps.io.</li>
<li>To create an area for your team in Google Analytics, to track the user analytics of your dashboard.</li>
</ul>
<p>Setting up a development/demo dashboard area:</p>
<ul>
<li>While developing your dashboard, you may want a private, demo-version to share with policy or senior colleagues for review and feedback. This version must use either published data or dummy data and can not use unpublished data, since this cannot be uploaded to GitHub until the day of publication (see our <a href="#dummy-data">dummy data guidance</a> for public dashboards).</li>
<li>Ensure that prior to contacting the statistics development team, you have updated all of the URL’s and other items listed above.</li>
<li>You must contact the <a href="mailto:statistics.development@education.gov.uk">Statistics Deveopment Team</a> to add the shinyapps.io secret and token to your GitHub repo, therefore enabling the app to be hosted on shinyapps.io. Once this is done you will have a browser link you can use to access the dashboard. We can make this private such that there is a list of approved viewers who must log in to view the dashboard - please provide the email addresses of any colleagues who you wish to have access to the private version during development.</li>
</ul>
<p>You must have done the following before a dashboard can be published (the statistics development team must review and approve that these have been met):</p>
<ul>
<li>Accessibility testing the dashboard and updating the accessibility statement. The <a href="#accessibility-testing">accessibility testing guidance</a> later in this section outlines how teams can do this.</li>
<li>You should test how your dashboard appears and performs on mobile devices. you can do this by opening your dashboard in chrome/edge, right clicking anywhere on the page and selecting ‘inspect’. you will then see a new panel on the right hand side of your screen. To see your dashboard how a mobile user would, click the mobile/tablet button (see the image below).</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="images/mobile_testing.PNG" /><!-- --></p>
<ul>
<li>Setting up UI and unit tests (UI tests are a part of the automated QA process and will run via GitHub actions each time you create a pull request). See our <a href="#ui-tests">guidance on UI tests</a> and <a href="#unit-tests">guidance on unit tests</a>.</li>
<li>Performance testing your dashboard. See our <a href="#performance-testing">guidance on performance testing</a>.</li>
<li>The underlying data for the dashboard must still be uploaded to EES in the tidy data format to be used in the table tool (check this using our <a href="https://rsconnect/rsc/dfe-published-data-qa/">data screener</a>)</li>
<li>Decide where you are going to provide the public the link to your dashboard. You can easily add a link to your EES publications. If you have a draft release that is going out on the same day as the dashboard, you can add the link into your EES draft while the shinyapps.io page is still private. This is because the link will not change when the dashboard is made public, the log-in screen will simply be removed.</li>
</ul>

</div>
</div>
<div id="standards-to-follow" class="section level2">
<h2>Standards to follow</h2>
<hr />
<p>We expect all dashboards to follow a minimum set of standards to ensure coherence between our products and a minimum standard of quality for our end users.</p>
<p>These standards are constantly evolving, and all feedback and contributions are welcome, contact us at <a href="mailto:statistics.development@education.gov.uk" class="email">statistics.development@education.gov.uk</a>.</p>
<hr />
<div id="accessibility-testing" class="section level3">
<h3>Accessibility testing</h3>
<hr />
<p>In line with <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/accessibility-requirements-for-public-sector-websites-and-apps">recent legislation</a> for public sector websites, all dashboards need to meet the latest <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/">Web Content Accessibility Guidance</a>.</p>
<p>As a minimum we expect all dashboards to be checked using the two tools below (lighthouse and shinya11y) and have an accessibility statement before being published.</p>
<p>Your statement should be written in line with the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/make-your-website-or-app-accessible-and-publish-an-accessibility-statement#publish-your-accessibility-statement">accessibility statement guidance</a>, and you can make use of a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/sample-accessibility-statement/sample-accessibility-statement-for-a-fictional-public-sector-website">template accessibility statement</a> provided by .gov.uk.</p>
<p>Lighthouse in Google Chrome is an easy way to quickly rate your accessibility. Open your app in Chrome, right click anywhere on the page and select “Inspect”. From there, navigate to “Lighthouse” in the top grey bar, and click “Generate report”. This generates scores for accessibility, best practices and SEO for your application or web page:</p>
<p><img src="images/lighthouse.gif" /><!-- --></p>
<p>To complement this, we recommend also using the <a href="https://github.com/ewenme/shinya11y">shinya11y</a> package to look at accessibility across your dashboard. Simply install and load the package, then include <code>use_tota11y()</code> at the top of your UI script. This brings up an interface that helps you examine different accessibility aspects in your app, like colour contrast, alt-text and what screen readers will detect:</p>
<p><img src="images/shinya11y_demo.gif" /><!-- --></p>
<p>Automated tools can’t check for everything and there’s no substitute for giving your dashboard a manual check. You should consider what users need from your dashboard and ensure that that information is accessible to all. For example, can someone using a screen reader get the same information as you can see on the screen from a downloadable csv or from the alt text that you have provided? Everything that you can see, you should also be able to read with a screen reader. Use the <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/complete-guide-to-narrator-e4397a0d-ef4f-b386-d8ae-c172f109bdb1">Edge narrator tool</a> to test out how your dashboard works in practice.</p>
<p>One example of a dashboard for Official statistics that meets these regulations is the <a href="https://department-for-education.shinyapps.io/la-school-places-scorecards">SCAP LA school places scorecards app</a>. Their accessibility statement is clearly labelled, explains what checks have been carried out, what the known limitations are and the plans in place to fix them:</p>
<p><img src="images/accessibility.PNG" /><!-- --></p>

<div id="styling" class="section level3">
<h3>Styling</h3>
<hr />
<!--

We don’t have an agreed style for Shiny apps / dashboards yet so need to agree one.

Have a look at how transferable the https://github.com/moj-analytical-services/shinyGovstyle stuff is.

Each report should include the department/agency logo in the top left corner. a version control page, accessibility statement,

-->
<p>All dashboards should have a link to the source code, and information about who to contact for feedback/issues. You should be familiar with and follow the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/style-guide/a-to-z-of-gov-uk-style">gov.uk style guide</a> as appropriate.</p>
<p>Teams should pick from the <a href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk/styles/colour/">gov.uk design system colours</a> when creating dashboards. The <a href="https://github.com/dfe-analytical-services/shiny-template/blob/main/www/shiny_gov_style.css">style sheet</a> in our <a href="https://github.com/dfe-analytical-services/shiny-template">template repository</a> makes use of these colours, though this can be extended if needed to suit your needs. Be careful when choosing colours, and make sure that colours have sufficient contrast to be placed next to each other to meet WCAG AA standards using the <a href="https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/">colour contrast checker</a>.</p>
<!-- Palette stuff to put in here too when complete -->
<p>Charts using ggplot2 and plotly can take custom palettes using the <code>scale_fill_manual()</code> function, e.g. below:</p>
<pre><code># Create colour palette using recommended colours (based on gov.uk design system)

dfe_colours &lt;- c(
  &quot;#12436D&quot;, #`blue`
  &quot;#F46A25&quot;,#`orange`
  &quot;#801650&quot;,#`maroon`
  &quot;#28A197&quot; #`turquoise`
  )

# Create chart using palette

ggplot(aes(y=value, x=&quot;&quot;,
                 fill = factor(rating),
                 text = paste(rating, &quot;: &quot;, value, &quot;%&quot;))) +
      geom_bar(stat=&quot;identity&quot;, position = position_fill(reverse = TRUE))+
      scale_fill_manual(values = dfe_colours)
</code></pre>
<p>Further examples are given on the <a href="ees.html#example-ggplot-chart-code">Using Explore Education Statistics guidance</a> page.</p>
<p>You can use in-line CSS to make these style changes, or make edits to the style sheet. Editing the style sheet is a neater solution if you want to apply changes across your app, and keeps your UI code clean. You can find out how styles are configured by running your app, right clicking and selecting “Inspect” to view the element you wish to change. You can then find these lines in the CSS stylesheet and change a number of things including fonts, font colours and background colours.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://department-for-education.shinyapps.io/la-school-places-scorecards">SCAP LA school places scorecards app</a> is one example of a public facing dashboard that meets these styling requirements.</p>

<div id="testing-r-shiny" class="section level3">
<h3>Testing R Shiny</h3>
<hr />
<p>To ensure that they are reliable, dashboards should have an appropriate amount of automated tests before they can be published. We recommend using a mix of UI and unit tests, but the number and type of tests that you need to run will depend on the content of your application.</p>
<p>Further guidance on setting up testing can be found in the <a href="https://dfe-analytical-services.github.io/good-code-practice/testing.html#testing-shiny-apps">DfE good code practice guide</a>. Also see our guidance on testing R code on the <a href="l+d.html#R">learning resources page</a>.</p>
<hr />
<div id="performance-testing" class="section level4">
<h4>Performance testing</h4>
<hr />
<p>Performance profiling represents a chance to breakdown how different elements within your dashboard perform relative to each other. This consists of running through a set of actions on a local run of your dashboard and timing each one. A useful tool for performing these tests is <strong>profvis</strong>, which carries out all the timings and visualisation of the results for you, whilst all you have to do is run the app and step through the actions that you want to profile.</p>
<p>The basic steps are as follows.</p>
<p>With your dashboard repository open in RStudio, run the following commands from the R console</p>
<p><code>install.packages("profvis")</code></p>
<p><code>profvis(shiny::runApp())</code></p>
<p>Then go through a set of interactions in your dashboard (e.g. navigate to the dashboard page, step through changing the selected choices in each input field, switch between any different tabs and cycle through the relevant inputs again). Once you’ve performed a representative range of actions in the dashboard, close the window and go back to the RStudio window.</p>
<p>After several seconds (depending on the range of actions you performed), a visualisation will appear in the main RStudio editor window showing the results of the profiling.</p>
<p>The profvis results are shown in the flame profiling chart. The top half of the chart shows any processing time measurements above 10ms for each line of code. It can be useful to focus in on lines that have measured times above 10ms by selecting “Hide lines of code with zero time” from the options menu in the top right.</p>
<p><img src="images/dashboards-testing-profvis.PNG" /><!-- --></p>
<p>Lines with timings of greater than about 5-100ms may warrant further investigation to see if they warrant some optimization. Common routes to optimising code are:</p>
<ul>
<li>avoid any data processing in server.R, e.g. avoid using the summarise() function;</li>
<li>use reactive() elements to minimise repeated calls of given functions;</li>
<li>use memoise() to cache results of more intensive functions (e.g. ggplot) to minimise repeated calls.</li>
</ul>
<p>The documentation for the <strong>profvis</strong> package can be found here: <a href="https://rstudio.github.io/profvis/">Profvis documentation</a></p>
<p>Whilst <strong>profvis</strong> can help identify any bottlenecks, this will ideally be complemented in the future by full load testing of dashboards, whereby the behaviour of dashboards under real-life high demand scenarios can be tested. However, this type of testing is unavailable whilst our applications are hosted on ShinyApps. We will offer support on load testing once we move dashboards on to our own server systems.</p>

<div id="ui-tests" class="section level4">
<h4>UI Tests</h4>
<hr />
<p>User interface (UI) tests should be used for all apps. These tests should check that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your app loads up correctly</li>
<li>Content appears as expected when you switch between tabs</li>
<li>Content updates as expected when you change inputs</li>
</ul>
<p>The <a href="https://rstudio.github.io/shinytest/">shinytest package</a> is a really easy way to create these tests on an RShiny app. Simply load in the package and run <code>shinytest::recordTest()</code> to open up the testing environment to get started.</p>
<p>Each test should produce one “expected results” JSON file. You can track particular elements of your app by holding CTRL and clicking on an element in the testing window.</p>
<p>For example, the <a href="https://github.com/dfe-analytical-services/la-school-places-scorecards/blob/main/tests/shinytest/UI_tests.R">SCAP LA school places scorecards app</a> has tests that check that the app functions as expected when different combinations of filters are selected.</p>
<p>Each test is separated out by comments, clearly stating what is being tested. - <strong>app<span class="math inline">\(setInputs()** tells the UI test to select an input in the app  - **app\)</span>snapshot()</strong> tells the UI test which outputs to capture (i.e. which outputs you’d expect to change and want to test)</p>
<p><img src="images/ui_test.PNG" /><!-- --></p>
<p>The expected outputs are saved in a <a href="https://github.com/dfe-analytical-services/la-school-places-scorecards/tree/main/tests/shinytest/UI_tests-expected">UI_tests-expected</a> folder, and every time you run a UI test, the outputs will be compared to these expected snapshots.</p>
<p>An example of a basic shiny test to check that your app loads up correctly can be found in our <a href="https://github.com/dfe-analytical-services/shiny-template">shiny template repo</a>.</p>
<hr />
</div>
<div id="unit-tests" class="section level4">
<h4>Unit Tests</h4>
<hr />
<p>Unit tests should be used for apps that contain custom functions created from scratch, or that rely on existing functions being combined to interact in a certain way.</p>
<p>Unit testing checks, for a set of defined variables, that the output is always the same when you run your custom function/s. This ensures that if slight tweaks are made to your function, or functions within packages you are using are updated, that your custom function still works.</p>
<p>For example, our <a href="https://github.com/dfe-analytical-services/dfe-published-data-qa/tree/master/tests/testthat">QA app</a> has many custom functions that we create to screen files before upload to EES. We have a series of dummy files that we have created to either pass or fail certain tests. Unit tests are written to check that these files always pass or fail as expected.</p>
<hr />
</div>
<div id="tests-and-deployment" class="section level4">
<h4>Tests and deployment</h4>
<hr />
<p>Both UI and unit tests need to be added to your app’s deployment pipeline. This ensures that the app will not be published if any of the tests fail.</p>
<p>We recommend using Github Actions to deploy the latest code whenever a push to your master branch occurs - this ensures that the published version of your app stays up to date.</p>
<p>You should also use GitHub Actions to run the automated tests for your app, which we recommend are done on at least every pull request.</p>
<p>If you’ve started from our <a href="https://github.com/dfe-analytical-services/shiny-template">template repository</a> then all of this will be mostly set up for you to tweak and expand on, but if you haven’t then you’ll need to add the yaml files from the <a href="">.github/workflows</a> folder to your repository.</p>
<p>GitHub actions are already well documented and <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions">their own guidance</a> should be able to walk you through anything you need. That being said, if there’s anything else you’d like to see here let us know.</p>
<!-- TODO:

What about profiling R code?

Have a small section on this in peer review - could link to it here too as something to consider? https://rsconnect/rsc/stats-production-guidance/rap.html#Review_of_code_within_team

StyleR

We have something on this in our RAP guidance https://rsconnect/rsc/stats-production-guidance/rap.html#clean-final-code so could link to that and provide more detail here about including style stuff in tests too?

Automated testing

Could add to the testing bit above? We have some bits in our RAP guidance https://rsconnect/rsc/stats-production-guidance/rap.html#Automated_quality_assurance but would be good to cover test that vs shiny test and point to template code repo that uses both

<div id="connecting-to-databases" class="section level3">
<h3>Connecting to databases</h3>
<hr />
<p>We don’t yet have a database server set up that can be accessed by public facing dashboards, though we are working to put this in place. In the meantime, there a few alternative options for storing data that the dashboard can run off.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Store the data within the repo (e.g. CSV files in a /data folder). Note that only published data should be stored in a repo. If your working on a dashboard that uses unpublished data then please see the <a href="#dummy-data">dummy data section</a> for guidance.</p></li>
<li><p>Use Google sheets</p></li>
<li><p>Use Dropbox</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If you are running an internal-only app then you can connect to our internal SQL servers, information on how to do this is in the <a href="https://teams.microsoft.com/l/team/19%3a311ec2e4d46b4dd38f0d61f05fb93383%40thread.skype/conversations?groupId=b95c605d-8fbc-4e4d-9a76-2f7d1c55e70a&amp;tenantId=fad277c9-c60a-4da1-b5f3-b3b8b34a82f9">R community teams area</a>.</p>

<div id="dfe-dashboard-template" class="section level1">
<h1>DfE Dashboard template</h1>
<hr />
<p>Our <a href="https://github.com/dfe-analytical-services/shiny-template">template shiny app repository</a> should be used a starting point for all public facing dashboards as it gives a consistent set up for publishing and provides template code for common parts. You can start your own repository using the ‘Use this template’ green button on the template repository. You will need a GitHub account to do this. If you are unsure or need help, contact the Statistics Development team who will be able to walk you through this.</p>
<hr />
<div id="whats-in-the-template" class="section level2">
<h2>What’s in the template</h2>
<hr />
<p>The template provides code for a basic interactive dashboard, with an example line chart using drop-downs for education level and geographic levels. It also includes an example accessibility statement (this is a requirement for all public dashboards and must be filled in, see the <a href="#accessibility">Accessibility</a> and <a href="#accessibility-testing">Accessibility testing</a> sections earlier in this guidance), and a ‘Support and feedback’ page with suggested contact information and links.</p>
<!-- Add a screenshot here when Rich finalises styling -->
<hr />
<div id="google-analytics" class="section level3">
<h3>Google analytics</h3>
<hr />
<p>The template has a google_analytics.html file which is set up to track all basic metrics, plus the inputs from both drop-downs. To set this up with your own app you will need a new tracking tag (the long number in the gtag()) which the statistics development team can provide you with. Please contact us in order to set this up.</p>
<p>If you are hosting your dashboard at multiple URLs (i.e. to cope with expected high traffic) then all URLs will be tracked using one tracking tag and analytics for all URLs will all appear as one in the same report.</p>
<hr />
</div>
<div id="data-files-log" class="section level3">
<h3>Data files log</h3>
<hr />
<p>The datafiles_log.csv file is a record of all of the data files saved in the repo, and whether or not the data is published. You should log all data files here and accurately record whether the data is published, unpublished or reference data.</p>
<hr />
</div>
<div id="stopping-accidental-data-uploads" class="section level3">
<h3>Stopping accidental data uploads</h3>
<hr />
<p>If you see any of the following errors, it is because you are trying to commit a data file to the GitHub repo that hasn’t been recorded as published:</p>
<p><code>Error: data/test_data.csv is not recorded in datafiles_log.csv.</code></p>
<p><code>Error: data/test_data.csv is not logged as published or reference data in datafiles_log.csv and is not found in .gitignore.</code></p>
<p>The template uses commit hooks and a datafiles_log.csv file. Commit hooks run automatically whenever you try to commit changes, and prevent any unpublished data being uploaded to the GitHub repo (see the <a href="#public-dashboards">public dashboards</a> and <a href="#dummy-data">dummy data</a> sections) by checking the datafiles_log.csv file.You should therefore record all data in the datafiles_log and record whether it is published, unpublished or reference dara. If you try to commit a file that is not recorded or is recorded as unpublished, git will not allow the commit. If you would like to save an unpublished data file locally to test the dashboard you should use the .gitignore file to ensure git ignores this file in your commits (see the <a href="#testing-with-unpublished-data">testing with unpublished data guidance</a>).</p>

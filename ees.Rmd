What is EES? 

Something like embedding the slides maybe.

Explore Education Statistics is a new platform designed to make DFE’s published statistics and data easier to find, access, use and understand. The admin service has been built so DFE statisticians can prepare their statistical releases and publish them in accordance with the predefined department release schedule. 

The service is currently in public beta, and is expected to replace the Department’s previous route for publishing statistics - via gov.uk. 

Previous service: Statistics collections on gov.uk	

•	Statisticians request pdf and excel files are uploaded to release pages on gov.uk.
•	Release attachments are reviewed and approved via emails.
•	Release attachments are circulated for pre-release via email 24hours prior to publication date.  	

New service: Explore Education Statistics

•  Statisticians load csv data files on to the service and use them to build release pages. 
•  Releases are reviewed and approved within the service.
•  Pre-release users are invited to preview releases within the service 24 hours prior to publication date.


Remember that this is a MVP service, we will be iterating and improving the functionality based on user feedback throughout 2020.

# Accessing EES

---



Access to the admin service is limited to DFE AD only and users have to have been invited to the service by either the BAU team (for full access) or an existing user (for pre-release access). Invites to the service are sent out using gov.uk Notify. 

To be invited to the service for full access the analyst would have to email a member of the BAU team (explore.statistics@education.gov.uk) to request access, stating what permissions they require and which publications they need access to. For junior staff this should be accompanied with the relevant team leader’s approval. 

The BAU team will be responsible for setting up and maintaining user permissions during the beta phase. Change requests will be monitored via the BAU mailbox (explore.statistics@education.gov.uk).

When you enter the service you’ll see the admin dashboard, here what you can see will be dependent on your access permissions i.e. you’ll only see the publications that you have been granted access to. Within the test environment users are set up with full permissions (i.e. they can see/do everything) though in our production environment this will be restricted. 

The BAU team will be responsible for setting up and maintaining user permissions during the beta phase. Change requests will be monitored via the BAU mailbox (explore.statistics@education.gov.uk). 

Within this dashboard you can access existing publications to create/edit their releases. Help and guidance is available in the administrators guide. 

You can use the drop down lists to find releases by theme/topic/publication or use the draft and schedule releases tabs to see releases that are in progress.

# Using the platform

---

Some intro text about general use of the platform and what it's for. 

Instructions:

1. Create new release

After finding the publication you want to create a release for, just press the button to create a new release. 

In the production environment, in the short term creating new releases can only be done by the BAU team – this is so we have awareness of all the early users within the admin site and can supply appropriate support. 

Once you have created your release you will see enter the ‘create release dashboard’:

Here, you need to work through the following steps in order to create your release:

A.	Manage data (uploading data files and adding footnotes)

B.	Manage data blocks (creating summary tables, charts and key stats indicators)

C.	Manage content (drafting release content)

D.	Release status (moving through approval process)

2. Uploading data

Here you will update your tidy date files and accompanying metadata. You need to make sure that the data has passed through our data screener checks before trying to upload it. 

Once you click to upload the file a ‘Status’ will be visible that shows the progress of the import process. It will go through the following stages:

•	Queued
•	Validating
•	Importing
•	Complete

This may take a little while depending on the size of your file and if there are numerous files queued for import. A XX MB file takes around X minutes to get to ‘COMPLETE’. You cannot view the dataset or use it to create tables/charts until this status is ‘COMPLETE’.

If you believe your file is ‘stuck’ please contact the BAU team.

To add footnotes, go to the footnotes tab and click 'add footnote'. Here you can select the individual indicators and filters you want to assign footnotes to, or if you'd rather, you can assign a footnote to the whole subject (data file). You can assign footnotes across multiple subjects. 

3. Data blocks

Once file imports are complete move to manage data blocks tab and use the admin table tool to create your summary tables. 

After building and saving a datablock table you will see there is now a ‘configure content’ tab – here you can choose to add a chart to your datablock.  

As you build your chart, you’ll be shown a live preview as you go. The configuration tabs can be done in any order, but it makes sense to add data first. You’ll add a series one at a time and can style each of them using the ‘change styling’ options.

Within the ‘chart configuration’ tab you can add a title, move the legend and change chart dimensions. 
Then move onto the x-axis configuration, here you can alter gridlines, labels, sort, limit and add reference lines.

Same for y-axis configuration, play around until the chart looks how you want it to.

If you create your chart and then change your mind as to what chart type would be best you can just click to change it and it will try to save all the options that you had applied previously.

Note, within the vertical and horizontal bar chart types you can also create stacked bar charts via the chart configuration options.

You can create maps too, though there are a few bugs around that at the moment – it should work fine for region, LA and LAD data, though remember your source table needs to include information for all geographies in your map to be able to map them.

Remember to save your chart when you’re done

4. Writing content

In the manage content tab you can now start creating your release, embedding the datablocks you’ve created as you go. 

You can use the page view toggles (bottom left of the page) to jump between edit and preview mode.

Use the ‘Add secondary stats’ button to add a datablock to your headline stats section. Key stats tiles also need to be created as a datablock table (creating a table as a single number only).

5. Changing release status

Once you’re happy with your release you need to change it’s status in order to move it through the release pipeline. 

There are three statuses:

1.	In draft (where the production team work on drafting the release)
2.	Ready for higher review (where the senior statistician checks over the release before approving)
3.	Approved for publication (when drafting and sign off is finished, releases in this status will be published on their scheduled go live date)

Only users with ‘responsible statistician’ permissions (usually G6 or above) can sign off the release for publication.  

6. Pre-release

Prior to each release going live the production team are also able to grant pre-release access to a named group of users 24 hours before it goes live. These users do not require full access (to the whole admin service) but will be able to see preview versions of any releases they have been granted access to. 

To invite a user, just add their email address. All invited users will receive an email to say that they have been given pre-release access and will get a url where the preview release will be available. 

This preview is only accessible for the 24hours before the publication date (though the emails may go out to users before then). We expect teams will continue to send an email at 09:30 on pre-release day, including any additional briefing and the link to the pre-release area.

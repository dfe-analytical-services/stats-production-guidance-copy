---

<div class="alert alert-dismissible alert-warning">
Use Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge to access and use the admin part of Explore Education Statistics.
</div>

When you enter the service you’ll see the admin dashboard, here what you can see will be dependent on your access permissions i.e. you’ll only see the publications that you have been granted access to. Within the test environment users are set up with full permissions (i.e. they can see/do everything) though in our production environment this will be restricted. 

The Statistics Development Team will be responsible for setting up and maintaining user permissions during the beta phase. Change requests will be monitored via their main mailbox - explore.statistics@education.gov.uk. 


`r knitr::include_graphics("images/EES-admin-dashboard.PNG")`


Within this dashboard you can access existing publications to create/edit their releases. You can use the drop down lists to find releases by theme/topic/publication or use the draft and schedule releases tabs to see releases that are in progress. 

Help and guidance for how to use the the admin website is available via the [administrators guide](https://admin.explore-education-statistics.service.gov.uk/documentation){target="_blank"}, this is always accessible from the top bar of the admin side of EES, as shown in the image below. 

`r knitr::include_graphics("images/admin_guide_access.png")`

# Publications 

---

The hierarchy of content within EES is as follows - 

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/ees-hierarchy.PNG")
```


Publications are organised into topics and themes (as shown on the EES Find Statistics page), and then within each publication there are releases - where the latest release includes the latest statistics for that publication. For example:

| Level | Example |
|:------|:------|
| Theme | Pupils and Schools |
| Topic | Pupil absence |
| Publication | Pupil absence in schools in England |
| Release | 2018/19 |

Each publication should have a lead statistician's name and contact details attached to it as a requirement of the Code of Practice. You may use a team email address but the name and telephone number of a named statistician must also be provided. 

To request a change to the contact details for a publication contact the [Statistics Development Team](mailto:explore.statistics@education.gov.uk).

Methodology documentation is also attached at a publication level within EES - meaning one standalone piece should be written to cover all releases for the given publication within the service. 

---

# Create new release

---

After finding the publication you want to create a release for, just press the button to create a new release. 

Currently the following tyes of release can be created in EES: 

* National Statistics (includes OSR tick mark logo at the top of the release page)  
* Official Statistics
* Adhoc Statistics

When creating a release you will be asked to fill in some release summary fields, including the scheduled publication date. 

<div class="alert alert-dismissible alert-info">
The time period for the release should reflect the time period of the data that this latest release adds to the time series.
</div>

You also have the option to add the 'next expected update date' for which you can provide the planned month and year of the next release within this publication. If this is added but then needs to be changed later in the year it is easy to do so, contact the [Statistics Development Team](mailto:explore.statistics@education.gov.uk) in the first instance.

<div class="alert alert-dismissible alert-warning">
For start of public beta, the Statistics Development Team are the only ones who can create new releases within the production environment – this is so we have awareness of all the early users within the admin site and can supply appropriate support. 
</div>

Once you have created your release you will see enter the ‘create release dashboard, here you need to work through the following tabs to create your release:

1.	Manage data (uploading data files and adding footnotes)

2.	Manage data blocks (creating summary tables, charts and key stats indicators)

3.	Manage content (drafting release content)

4.	Release status (moving through the approval process)


`r knitr::include_graphics("images/EES-create-release-dashboard.PNG")`

---

# Uploading data

---

Here you will update your tidy data files and accompanying metadata. You need to make sure that the data has passed through our data screener checks before trying to upload it. 

<div class="alert alert-dismissible alert-info">
  Planning area, School, Provider, and Institution level data will upload as normal to EES, though will not be read into the table tool or data blocks, as they are not yet designed for these levels of data. All data, including these levels are accessible in the downloadable files for users to explore in the same format as they are uploaded. Any data files that only consist of these levels should be uploaded as an ancillary file, rather than as a data file.
</div>

Once you click to upload the file a ‘Status’ will be visible that shows the progress of the import process. It will go through the following stages:

* Queued
* Validating
* Importing
* Complete

This may take a little while depending on the size of your file and if there are numerous files queued for import. You cannot view the dataset or use it to create tables/charts until this status is ‘COMPLETE’.

<div class="alert alert-dismissible alert-warning">
If you believe your file is ‘stuck’ please contact explore.statistics@education.gov.uk, with details of the file and the release that you are uploading to.
</div>

To add footnotes, go to the footnotes tab and click 'add footnote'. Here you can select the individual indicators and filters you want to assign footnotes to, or if you'd rather, you can assign a footnote to the whole subject (data file). You can assign footnotes across multiple subjects. 

---

# Data block tables

---

Once file imports are complete move to manage data blocks tab and use the admin table tool to create your summary tables. Here you can also use the reorder table headers tool to restructure your table howwver you want it. 

Once you're happy with your table, give it a title and some source information before clicking save. 

**Table highlights**

You can also choose to highlight a data block table as a ‘top table’ which means it will show in a list of table highlights within the table tool. This is designed to help users get to tables of interest more quickly (without having to create tables themselves).

There is an option to choose if a table is a 'highlight table' when saving each data block:

`r knitr::include_graphics("images/EES-create-release-table-highlight.PNG")`

Each highlight table will then be listed to the user within the table tool. Highlight tables do not have to be embedded within your release content to be included in this list. 

`r knitr::include_graphics("images/EES-table-tool-highlights.PNG")`


**Fast track links**

Any data block tables that are created and saved within the admin app will also be assigned a ‘fast-track link’, this url can then be used throughout your release as a way to direct users to specific tables (within the table tool) more quickly so they can interact and explore the data further.  It will appear at the top of the page like this:

`r knitr::include_graphics("images/EES-create-release-fasttrack-url.PNG")`


When your release is published, any embedded data block tables within the release will have an 'explore data button' beneath them which will utilise these fast track links to quickly direct users to the table within the table tool so they can explore the data further. You can also use fast-track links as a hyperlink within release commentary (without having to embed the data block). 

<div class="alert alert-dismissible alert-info">
**What is the difference between a fast-track link and a permalink?**

EES also offers 'permalinks' for any table created in the table tool which allows a user to save a link to a permanent, static, version of a table they have created. Analysts can make use of these permalinks when answering queries or in PQ and FOI responses. 

Fast-track links are similar to permalinks however instead of linking to a static version of a table they link to an 'active' version of the table within the table tool - meaning users can interact and change what's shown in the table from within the table tool if they choose to.  
</div>

# Data block charts

---

After building and saving a data block table you will see a 'Chart' tab appears. This tab will take you to the EES chart builder, where you can choose to add a chart to your data block.

The first step to creating a chart is choosing the chart type, currently the EES chart builder can build line charts, horizotnal/vertical bar charts (including stacked) and maps. We intend to grow this list over the course of public beta so please let us know if a chart type you want to create is not possible. 

After choosing your chart type you then need to work through the following stages and you’ll be shown a live preview as you go: 

**Chart configuration**

Within the ‘chart configuration’ tab you can add a title, alt text, move the legend and change chart dimensions. 

`r knitr::include_graphics("images/EES-charts-create.PNG")`

Note, within the vertical and horizontal bar chart types you can also create stacked bar charts via the chart configuration options.

**Data sets**

Here is where you add data to the chart. Each series is added one at a time and can be styled individually using the ‘change styling’ options.

`r knitr::include_graphics("images/EES-charts-add-data.PNG")`

**X axis (major axis)**

Here is where you configure the x-axis: You can alter gridlines, labels, sort, limit and add reference lines.

`r knitr::include_graphics("images/EES-charts-xaxis.PNG")`

|Option|What it does|
|---------|---------|
|Size of axis |Change the width of the space given to axis tick labels|
|Group data by |Change how the data within the chart is grouped|
|Show grid lines |Turn grid lines on and off|
|Show axis |Turn the axis on and off, you can also add a unit to the axis tick labels|
|Sorting |Change how the data within the chart is sorted|
|Tick display type |Alter how often axis tick labels are shown, labels will automatically skip values where there are too many to show without overlapping|
|Axis range |Alter the range of data shown in the chart|
|Label |Add an axis label, you can also choose the width for the space given to it|
|Reference lines |Add/remove  reference lines to the chart|


**Y axis (minor axis)**

Then follow a similar process for the y axis configuration, play around until the chart looks how you want it to.

`r knitr::include_graphics("images/EES-charts-yaxis.PNG")`

|Option|What it does|
|---------|---------|
|Size of axis |Change the width of the space given to axis tick labels|
|Group data by |Change how the data within the chart is grouped|
|Show grid lines |Turn grid lines on and off|
|Show axis |Turn the axis on and off, you can also add a unit to the axis tick labels|
|Sorting |Change how the data within the chart is sorted|
|Tick display type |Alter how often axis tick labels are shown, labels will automatically skip values where there are too many to show without overlapping|
|Axis range |Alter the range of data shown in the chart|
|Label |Add an axis label, you can also choose the width for the space given to it|
|Reference lines |Add/remove  reference lines to the chart|

**Changing chart type**

If you create your chart and then change your mind as to what chart type would be best you can just click to change it and it will try to save all the options that you had applied previously.

`r knitr::include_graphics("images/EES-charts-change-type.PNG")`

You can create maps too, currently this is possible for regional, LA and LAD data, though remember your source table needs to include information for all geographies in your map to be able to map them.

<div class="alert alert-dismissible alert-info">
Remember to save your chart when you’re done.
</div>

**What to do if the chart you want to build is not possible**

You should only use complex charts where there is a clear user need, as simple charts are the easiest for users to understand. If you have a an infographic or a chart that is too complex to build within our chart builder you can use the 'Choose an infographic as alternative' option to upload an image to your data block instead. These should be .png format and you can use the sizing options within the data block editor to size your image appropriately. 

`r knitr::include_graphics("images/EES-charts-infographic.PNG")`

---

# Writing content

---

In the manage content tab you can now start creating your release, embedding the datablocks you’ve created as you go. 

You can use the page view toggles, that float in the bottom left of the page, to jump between edit and preview mode.

Use the ‘Add secondary stats’ button to add a datablock to your headline stats section. 

Use the 'Key stats' options to add key statistic tiles to your release. For each tile you first have to have created a datablock table - creating a table as a single number only.

`r knitr::include_graphics("images/key-stat.PNG")`

After embedding a key stat tile you can then edit it to add trend information and a desription of what the indicator is. 

| Element | Content |
|---------|---------|
| Indicator name | Automatically generated from your data | 
| Latest value | Automatically generated from your data |
| Trend | A short one-sentence description of the trend; try to avoid only stating the change from the previous year and talk about the longer-term trend where appropriate |
| Guidance title | Should be set to 'What is this?' |
| Guidance text | A simple description in plain English of what the indicator is |

You can then create accordion sections to start adding your main release commentary. These sections are made up of text blocks and data blocks which can be reordered as needed. 

Any data tables should be included as data blocks, however you can also embed static html tables within a text box. These should only be used to present textual tables or for any small presentations of data that are not possible to do in a data block at the moment. 

You can create static html tables for presenting information that isn't embedded in a datablock. However, remember that *all of the data* included or referred to in your content should be available (or createable) from the downloadable underlying data files.

---

# Changing release status

---

Once you’re happy with your release you need to change it’s status in order to move it through the release pipeline. 

There are three statuses:

1.	**In draft** (where the production team work on drafting the release)
2.	**Ready for higher review** (where the senior statistician checks over the release before approving)
3.	**Approved for publication** (after approval has been given, releases in this status will be published on their scheduled date)


<div class="alert alert-dismissible alert-warning">
Only users with ‘responsible statistician’ permissions (usually G6 or above) can sign off the release for publication.  
</div>


**How to approve a release**

Releases are approved via the release status tab. The release date is also set during this stage of the process. 

`r knitr::include_graphics("images/ees-approving-release.PNG")`

The approver also has the ability to approve the release to ‘publish as soon as possible’ instead of scheduling the release for a specific day, this is primarily intended for when publishing amendments to existing releases. 

---

# Pre-release

---

Prior to each release going live the production team are also able to grant pre-release access to a named group of users 24 hours before it goes live. These users do not require full access to the whole admin service. They will be able to see preview versions of any releases they have been granted access to. 

To invite a user, just add their email address. This option is only visible once the release has been marked as 'approved for release', and can be found in the 'Scheduled releases' tab of the admin dashboard. All invited users will receive an email to say that they have been given pre-release access and will get a url where the preview release will be available. 

<div class="alert alert-dismissible alert-info">
Please note that jobshare emails should not be sent invites for pre-release. The personal emails for the specific individuals should be used instead, as jobshare emails do not have active accounts with DfE to access EES.
</div>

This preview is only accessible for the 24 hours before the publication date, the emails may go out to users before then. We expect teams will continue to send an email at 09:30 on pre-release day, including any additional briefing and the link to the pre-release area.

# Methodology

---

Methodologies work in a very similar way to the written content of a release, the text editor and static tables you can use are built on the same foundations. 

On the production environment, teams need to request a blank methodology to be created for them, please contact the [Statistics Development Team](mailto:explore.statistics@education.gov.uk) to arrange this.

Once the drafting has finished, a methodology should be set as 'approved for publication'. After this has happened, it will then appear in the drop down menu to attach to a publication. The methodology will then be published to the public side of the platform with the next release.

On the test environment, teams can test creating methodologies themselves by going into the 'manage methodologies' page that is accessible from the main admin dashboard.

---

# Amending a release

---

If you need to make an amendment to release that has already been published this is now possible to do from within the admin dashboard:


`r knitr::include_graphics("images/EES-amend-release.PNG")`

Creating an amendment of a release will create a new version for which you can make any changes and then choose to republish, either as soon as possible or on a given date. 

**Release notes**

When publishing a new amendment you should add a 'release note' to your release so users can be informed of what has changed - 

`r knitr::include_graphics("images/EES-release-note.PNG")`

<p class="text-muted">Guidance for how to use the features in the Explore Education Statistics platform</p>

---

Explore Education Statistics (EES) is the Department’s official statistics dissemination platform, designed to make DFE’s published statistics and data easier to find, access, use and understand.

**The EES platform consists of two applications:**

1. The [public](https://explore-education-statistics.service.gov.uk/) website, where users access stats

2. The [admin](https://admin.explore-education-statistics.service.gov.uk/) website, where production teams create their stats

<div class="alert alert-dismissible alert-info">
The majority of the admin side of EES is only supported in Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge and will not work correctly in Internet Explorer. The public website and pre-release previews of releases in admin can be viewed using Internet Explorer, though we still recommend that people use Chrome or Edge instead.
</div>

Both applications were released to Minimal Viable Product (MVP) standard in March 2020, we will be iterating and improving the functionality based on user feedback throughout 2020 and 2021. 

Maintenance and use of the platform is supported by the [Statistics Development Team](mailto:explore.statistics@education.gov.uk).

# Accessing EES

---

## Environments

---

As stated above, EES consists of two parts. We also have four versions (environments) of EES, the banner for the admin part of each environment will inform you which environment you are on, this is also colour coded: 

- **Development** - Green - where changes are first merged in, and often the first time different pieces of work from different developers will interact properly

- **Test** - Pink - where our developers can carry out manual testing of any new features to make sure things work as expected 

- **Pre-production** - Yellow - a sandbox area for analysts to carry out functionality testing

    Admin pre-production - https://admin.pre-production.explore-education-statistics.service.gov.uk

    Public pre-production - https://pre-production.explore-education-statistics.service.gov.uk

- **Production** - Red - the real service, anyone creating real releases that they intend to publish to the public should be using this environment

    Admin - https://admin.explore-education-statistics.service.gov.uk

    Public - https://explore-education-statistics.service.gov.uk

There is no overlap between the environments and content created on one cannot be moved to any other. 

<div class="alert alert-dismissible alert-danger">
If you are bookmarking links, please be careful to bookmark the links below exactly as they are shown. Often when signing in you will be redirected via other url's as a part of the authentication process, and bookmarking those may lead to errors.
</div>

Teams can use the pre-production environment to familiarise themselves with the platform and test out what is possible. The core functionality across the environments is identical except for new changes, which are deployed through the different environments before they make it to production. 

On the pre-production environment, all analysts have full permissions to create publications and releases, and can see everything else that other analysts are making. This is unique to the pre-production environment, on the production environment analysts will only have access to releases that they have been granted specific access to.

When accessing the pre-production environment you may be asked for a username and password, these are as follows: dfe, dataresearch.

<div class="alert alert-dismissible alert-danger">
The pre-production environment is not suitable for unpublished data. Unpublished data should only be uploaded to the production environment.
</div>


### Getting access to admin

Access to the production and pre-production admin services is limited to DfE AD accounts only and users have to have been invited to the service by either the Statistics Development Team (for full access) or an existing user (for pre-release access). Invites to the service are sent out via email using gov.uk Notify. 

To be invited to the service for full access teams need to email the [Explore Statistics Mailbox](mailto:explore.statistics@education.gov.uk), stating who needs access, what permissions they require (analyst or approver), and for which publications these apply. This email should be sent by the Team Leader, or accompanied with the relevant Team Leader’s approval. Once access has been granted you will receive an email inviting you to use the platform.

<div class="alert alert-dismissible alert-info">
Jobshare emails can not be used to access EES. Specific personal emails should be used instead, in the same way as you sign in to windows on your machine.
</div>

## Roles and permissions

---

<!-- need to include methodologies in this section? -->
<!-- An overview of roles and permissions is illustrated below: -->

<!-- ```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'} -->
<!-- knitr::include_graphics("images/EES_roles.svg") -->
<!-- ``` -->

The Statistics Development Team are responsible for setting up and maintaining user permissions during the beta phase. Change requests will be monitored via their main mailbox - explore.statistics@education.gov.uk. 

The following roles exist within EES admin and are assigned to a specific release: 

* **Pre-release**

    Any user invited for pre-release is given a pre-release user role. During the hours of pre-release they can:
    
    + Preview the release page, including downloading files
    + Preview the table tool page for that release

<br>

* **Analyst - contributor**

    Any analyst working on a release within EES admin will have the contributor role. They can:
    
    + Edit release details
    + Upload data and other files
    + Create footnotes, datablocks and charts
    + Edit and comment on release content
    + Invite PRA users
    + Move the release status between draft and ready for higher review
    
<br>

* **Analyst - approver**

    The responsible statistician for a statistics release will have the approver role, allowing them to sign off releases for publication. This will usually be the responsible G5 or G6 for the statistics publication. They can do everything a contributor can, as well as:
    
    + Move the release status between draft, ready for review and approved
    + Schedule the release for publication (either immediately or for a specific date)

<br>

There is also a publication owner role, which is assigned at publication level to a users account:

* **Publication owner**

    This permissions level gives publication owners control over their publications. They can do anything a contributor can for all releases within the publication. On top of this the publication owner also has access to:

    + Manage publication level details
    + Create new releases within a publication
    + Create an amendment of the latest published release within a publication
    + Cancel an amendment before it is published

<br>


* **BAU**

    The administrative role:

    + This role is assigned to a user and gives full access including administrative tools, typically only used by the Statistics Development Team and EES developers.
    


---

## Requesting a new publication

---

If you have not published on EES before, or if you're creating a brand new publication, you will need to contact us to create the publication for you before you can get started. 

The hierarchy of content within EES is as follows - 

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/ees-hierarchy.PNG")
```

Publications are organised into topics and themes (as shown on the EES [Find Statistics page](https://explore-education-statistics.service.gov.uk/find-statistics)), and then within each publication there are releases - where the latest release includes the latest statistics for that publication. For example:

| Level | Example |
|:------|:------|
| Theme | Pupils and Schools |
| Topic | School and pupil numbers |
| Publication | Schools, pupils and their characteristics |
| Release | 2020/21 |

Each publication should have a lead statistician's name and contact details attached to it as a requirement of the Code of Practice. You may use a team email address but the name and telephone number of a named statistician should also be provided. 

Publication titles should not include any references to geography (e.g. "in England"), time period or badging of statistics, all of this information will be made clear at release level in the header and summary boxes.

Methodology documentation is also attached at a publication level within EES - meaning one standalone piece should be written to cover all releases for the given publication within the service. 

If you want to request a new publication, please be prepared to give the following:

+ The heading and subheading that you want the publication to sit under in our site (take a look at the current structure [here](https://explore-education-statistics.service.gov.uk/find-statistics){target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}), feel free to either use existing ones, or suggest new ones
+ The exact title of the publication
+ If the methodology already exists elsewhere and you have a URL for it, or if you want to [create one](#Methodology)
+ Team name
+ Team email address
+ Lead statistician name
+ Lead statistician contact number
+ The [time period](ud.html#List_of_allowable_time_values) of the release you’re creating
+ Whether they are National statistics, an ad-hoc publication, or official statistics
+ List of email addresses of analysts who need access to the release and at what [permission levels](#Roles_and_permissions)


Publication details can be [managed by publication owners](#Publication_management) or via requests to the [Explore Statistics Mailbox](mailto:explore.statistics@education.gov.uk). 

---

## Admin dashboard

---

<div class="alert alert-dismissible alert-warning">
Use Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge to access and use the admin part of Explore Education Statistics.
</div>

When you enter the service you’ll see the admin dashboard, here what you can see will be dependent on your access permissions i.e. you’ll only see the publications that you have been granted access to. Within the test environment users are set up with full permissions (i.e. they can see/do everything) though in our production environment this will be restricted. 

The Statistics Development Team will be responsible for setting up and maintaining user permissions during the beta phase. Change requests will be monitored via their EES mailbox - explore.statistics@education.gov.uk. 


`r knitr::include_graphics("images/EES-admin-dashboard.PNG")`


Within this dashboard you can view and manage existing publications, including creating and editing their releases. You can use the drop down lists to find releases by theme/topic/publication or use the draft and scheduled releases tabs to see releases that are in progress. 

---

# Creating releases

---

New releases can be [created by publication owners](#Create_new_release) or via requests to the [Explore Statistics Mailbox](mailto:explore.statistics@education.gov.uk). If you're requesting a new release via the mailbox, please give the following:

+ Name of the publication (including theme and topic that it sits under)
+ Time period for the release
+ [Time identifier](ud.html#List_of_allowable_time_values) for the release
+ Type of release (National, Official, Ad-hoc etc)

Once you have created your release you will see enter the ‘create release dashboard, here you need to work through the following tabs to create your release:

1.	Data and files (uploading data files, ancillary files and creating public metadata)

2.  Footnotes (creating footnotes and assigning to relevant data)

2.	Data blocks (creating summary tables, charts and key stats indicators)

3.	Content (drafting release content)

4.	Sign off (moving through the approval process)

5.  Pre-release access (invite users to pre-release and create public pre-release list)


`r knitr::include_graphics("images/EES-create-release-dashboard.PNG")`

---

## Data and files

---

Here you will update your data files and accompanying metadata. You need to make sure that the data has passed through our [data screener checks](https://rsconnect/rsc/dfe-published-data-qa/) before trying to upload it. 

<div class="alert alert-dismissible alert-info">
All data files are accessible in the downloadable files for users to explore in the same format as they are uploaded.
</div>

---

### Subject titles

---

You'll need to give a 'subject title' to each data file you upload. The subject name should be a simple user-friendly title for the data included within the file - it is what users will see wherever the file is referenced within EES. The actual file name and metadata guidance can include more technical / coverage information.

When adding a subject name think about the general user and how the subjects will appear in the service:

* You don't need to include the publication name in the subject name as this is always already implied within EES

* You don't need to list what filters are in each file in the title, users can see this in the metadata guidance

* You don't need to include the date ranges covered in each file in the title, users can see this in the metadata guidance

* Your subject names should be short and snappy, clearly explain what is in each file. Some good examples of this in practice are included below:
  + Early years provision by provider type
  + Exclusions and suspensions by pupil characteristics
  + ITT new entrants by subject and training route

You can make changes the subject title for your data file after it has been uploaded if needed using the 'Edit title' option. 

---

### Uploading files

---

When uploading files you have a choice between uploading as separate CSV files or as a combined ZIP file. 

For data files greater than 80mb we recommend uploading as a ZIP file.

Once you click to upload the file a ‘Status’ will be visible that shows the progress of the import process. It will go through the following stages:

* Queued
* Validating
* Importing
* Complete

This may take a little while depending on the size of your file and if there are numerous files queued for import. You cannot view the dataset or use it to create tables/charts until this status is ‘COMPLETE’.

<div class="alert alert-dismissible alert-warning">
If you believe your file is ‘stuck’ please contact explore.statistics@education.gov.uk, with details of the file and the release that you are uploading to.
</div>



---

### Ancillary file uploads

---

Any files you want to make available for users to download but aren't intended the table tool should be added as an ancillary file upload. These files will need to meet all requirements of the new [accesibility regulations](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/publishing-accessible-documents) before they can be published. 

Examples of ancillary files may be: 

* Infographic pages
* Supplementary data that isn't intended for the table tool 
* Additional technical documentation

<div class="alert alert-dismissible alert-info">
Any data files that only consist of Planning area, and/or Institution level data should be uploaded as an ancillary file, rather than as a data file.
</div>

---

### Public data guidance

---

Here you should also create your [public data guidance](https://explore-education-statistics.service.gov.uk/find-statistics/permanent-and-fixed-period-exclusions-in-england/meta-guidance) document, this replaces the information that would have previously been uploaded as a pdf and is designed to help users understand and use the data they download from your release.

`r knitr::include_graphics("images/admin-public-meta-start.PNG")`

The document will automatically update as you add new data files to your release, however you will need to add an overview of all the data included in the release and short summaries for each data file before the release can be published. 

A list of variables in each file with an associated label (taken from metadata uploads) and associated footnotes will also be displayed for each file. 

`r knitr::include_graphics("images/admin-public-meta-detail.PNG")`

<div class="alert alert-dismissible alert-danger">
Releases cannot be published without a completed metadata document. If not filled in an error will be flagged during sign off. 
</div>

---

### Replacing data

---

If you just need to change the subject title for your data file you do not need to go through the whole replacement process, just click the 'Edit title' option. 

However, if you notice a mistake in your data file you can replace it with another. When replacing a data file the platform will attempt to recreate any data blocks and footnotes that were built using the previous file.

`r knitr::include_graphics("images/replace-data-start.png")`

The first step is to upload the new file.

`r knitr::include_graphics("images/replace-data-step1.PNG")`

One you've chosen and uploaded your replacement file it will need to go through the usual import process before it can check if retaining existing data blocks and footnotes will be possible.

`r knitr::include_graphics("images/replace-data-step2.PNG")`

Once the upload is finished a report will appear which highlights whether existing data blocks and footnotes can be replaced successfully. If you want to keep any data blocks and footnotes you've built you will need to make sure that your replacement data file still contains the information (indicators, filters, geographic_levels and time_periods) that was used to create them.

`r knitr::include_graphics("images/replace-data-success.PNG")`

If it's not possible for a data block or footnote to be recreated using the replacing data file a warning will appear and you'll be prompted to either edit or delete them before completing the replacement.

`r knitr::include_graphics("images/replace-data-fail.PNG")`

<div class="alert alert-dismissible alert-danger">
Remember to double check any data blocks or footnotes that were recreated by the platform before publishing your release.
</div>

---

## Footnotes

---

Footnotes are added via footnotes tab - rather than writing multiple tables and assigning individual footnotes, you write footnotes and assign them to certain indicators and filters so they appear when users select them in the table builder. For example in the below, the footnote "This is a footnote" is assigned to "Headcount" indicator for all options within the "School type" filter.

`r knitr::include_graphics("images/footnote_example.PNG")`

If you'd rather, you can assign a footnote to the whole data file by ticking this box. 

`r knitr::include_graphics("images/All_indicators.PNG")`

You can assign the same footnote across multiple data files.  

<div class="alert alert-dismissible alert-danger">
We recommend that you only add footnotes once you are certain the data file is final. If you have to delete the data file, all the assigned footnotes will be deleted alongside it.
</div> 

---

## Data blocks (tables and charts) 

---

A data block is a smaller cut of data from your original file that you can embed into your publication as a presentation table, build charts from, or link users directly to.

---

### Tables

---

Here you can create data blocks, using the admin table tool to create and save your summary tables. Remember to use the reorder table headers tool to restructure your table however you want it before you save. 

Once you're happy with your table, give it a title and some source information before clicking save. The source should be the source of the data used to create the data file that was then used for the data block table, for example 'School Census'.

The manage data blocks page will list all the data blocks you have created, highlighting which have charts, are used in content and are saved as highlight tables. 

`r knitr::include_graphics("images/ees-manage-data-blocks.PNG")`


---

#### Featured tables

---

You can also choose to highlight a data block table as a ‘featured table’ which means it will show in a list of featured tables within the table tool. This is designed to help users get to tables of interest more quickly (without having to create tables themselves).

There is an option to choose if a table is a 'featured table' when saving each data block, here you can name the table and add a description giving the table coverage:

`r knitr::include_graphics("images/EES-create-release-table-highlight.PNG")`

Each featured table will then be listed to the user within the table tool. Featured tables do not have to be embedded within your release content to be included in this list. 

`r knitr::include_graphics("images/EES-table-tool-highlights.PNG")`

---

#### Fast track links

---

Any data block tables that are created and saved within the admin app will also be assigned a ‘fast-track link’, this url can then be used throughout your release as a way to direct users to specific tables (within the table tool) more quickly so they can interact and explore the data further.  It will appear at the top of the page like this:

`r knitr::include_graphics("images/EES-create-release-fasttrack-url.PNG")`


When your release is published, any embedded data block tables within the release will have an 'explore data button' beneath them which will utilise these fast track links to quickly direct users to the table within the table tool so they can explore the data further. You can also use fast-track links as a hyperlink within release commentary (without having to embed the data block). 

<div class="alert alert-dismissible alert-info">
**What is the difference between a fast-track link and a permalink?**

EES also offers 'permalinks' for any table created in the table tool which allows a user to save a link to a permanent, static, version of a table they have created. Analysts can make use of these permalinks when answering queries or in PQ and FOI responses. 

Fast-track links are similar to permalinks however instead of linking to a static version of a table they link to an 'active' version of the table within the table tool - meaning users can interact and change what's shown in the table from within the table tool if they choose to.  
</div>


---

### Charts

---

After building and saving a data block table you will see a 'Chart' tab appears. This tab will take you to the EES chart builder, where you can choose to add a chart to your data block.

The first step to creating a chart is choosing the chart type, currently the EES chart builder can build line charts, horizontal/vertical bar charts (including stacked and clustered) and maps.

After choosing your chart type you then need to work through the following stages to build your chart. In each stage you’ll be shown a live preview as you make changes.

---

#### Chart configuration

---

Within the ‘chart configuration’ tab you can add a title, alt text, move the legend and change chart dimensions. 

<div class="alert alert-dismissible alert-info">
Make sure to review your chart dimensions before you publish. Users should be able to read the labels on the axes and see the legend without having to scroll.
</div>

`r knitr::include_graphics("images/EES-charts-create.PNG")`

Note, within the vertical and horizontal bar chart types you can also create stacked bar charts by clicking the 'Stacked bars' option within the chart configuration tab

---

#### Data sets

---

Here is where you add data to the chart. You can add each series one at a time or all together.

`r knitr::include_graphics("images/EES-charts-add-data.PNG")`

---

#### Legend

---

You can edit the chart legend, and styling of your series via the Legend tab. 

`r knitr::include_graphics("images/EES-charts-legend.PNG")`


---

#### X axis (major axis)

---

Here is where you configure the x-axis: You can alter gridlines, labels, sort, limit and add reference lines.

`r knitr::include_graphics("images/EES-charts-xaxis.PNG")`

|Option|What it does|
|---------|---------|
|Size of axis |Change the width of the space given to axis tick labels|
|Show grid lines |Turn grid lines on and off|
|Show axis |Turn the axis on and off, you can also add a unit to the axis tick labels|
|Sorting |Change how the data within the chart is sorted|
|Tick display type |Alter how often axis tick labels are shown, labels will automatically skip values where there are too many to show without overlapping|
|Axis range |Alter the range of data shown in the chart|
|Label |Add an axis label, you can also choose the width for the space given to it|
|Reference lines |Add/remove  reference lines to the chart|

---

#### Y axis (minor axis)

---

Then follow a similar process for the y axis configuration, play around until the chart looks how you want it to.

`r knitr::include_graphics("images/EES-charts-yaxis.PNG")`

|Option|What it does|
|---------|---------|
|Size of axis |Change the width of the space given to axis tick labels|
|Group data by |Change how the data within the chart is grouped|
|Show grid lines |Turn grid lines on and off|
|Show axis |Turn the axis on and off, you can also add a unit to the axis tick labels|
|Sorting |Change how the data within the chart is sorted|
|Tick display type |Alter how often axis tick labels are shown, labels will automatically skip values where there are too many to show without overlapping|
|Axis range |Alter the range of data shown in the chart|
|Label |Add an axis label, you can also choose the width for the space given to it|
|Reference lines |Add/remove  reference lines to the chart|

---

#### Changing chart type

---

If you create your chart and then change your mind as to what chart type would be best you can just click to change it and it will try to save all the options that you had applied previously.

`r knitr::include_graphics("images/EES-charts-change-type.PNG")`


<div class="alert alert-dismissible alert-info">
Remember to save your chart when you’re done.
</div>

---

#### Maps

---

You can create maps too, currently this is possible for regional, LA and LAD data.

You can change the boundaries you are plotting onto via the "chart configuration" tab, the latest boundary file will automatically be selected, but if you are visualising historic data, you may want an older boundary file. Please [contact us](mailto:explore.statistics@education.gov.uk) if the boundary you want to plot is unavailable.

`r knitr::include_graphics("images/map_config.png")`

Then to create a map, add the cuts of data you want to display in the "data sets" tab of the chart builder.

`r knitr::include_graphics("images/map_add_data.PNG")`

You can change the colour scale of the chart in the "legend" tab.

`r knitr::include_graphics("images/map_change_legend.png")`

---

#### Other chart types

---

You should only use complex charts where there is a clear user need, as simple charts are the easiest for users to understand. If you have a an infographic or a chart that is too complex to build within our chart builder you can use the 'Choose an infographic as alternative' option to upload an image to your data block instead. These should be .svg format and you can use the sizing options within the data block editor to size your image appropriately. 

<div class="alert alert-dismissible alert-info">
Accessibility matters for infographics too, consider the following if you do need to upload an image - 

* Keep them simple
* Use only colours that are also available in EES - see our [visualisation guidance](cd.html#Charts-in-EES) for more details
* Don't put borders around images
* Ensure there is a high enough colour contrast ratio between elements. You can use a [colour contrast checker](https://contrast-checker.glitch.me/) to check the colours you're using
* Try to avoid adding text to your images other than axis labels and limited annotations. Titles and headings can be added in the "chart configuration" tab instead

</div>


---

## Content

---

In the content tab you can now start creating your release, embedding the data blocks you’ve created as you go. 

<!-- we shoud gif --> 

You can use the page view toggles, that float in the bottom left of the page, to jump between edit and preview mode for the release and to view a preview of the table tool.

<!-- we should gif --> 

Use the ‘Add secondary stats’ button to add a data block to your headline stats section. 

Use the 'Key stats' options to add key statistic tiles to your release. For each tile you first have to have created a data block that contains only one number.

`r knitr::include_graphics("images/key-stat.PNG")`

After embedding a key stat tile you can then edit it to add trend information and a description of what the indicator is. 

| Element | Content |
|---------|---------|
| Indicator name | Automatically generated from your data | 
| Latest value | Automatically generated from your data |
| Trend | A short one-sentence description of the trend; try to avoid only stating the change from the previous year and talk about the longer-term trend where appropriate |
| Guidance title | E.g. 'What is NEET?' or 'What are permanent exclusions?' |
| Guidance text | A simple description in plain English of what the indicator is |

You can then create accordion sections to start adding your main release commentary. These sections are made up of text blocks and data blocks which can be reordered as needed. 

<div class="alert alert-dismissible alert-info">
Do not use footnotes in the text of your content. They’re designed for reference in print, not web pages. If the information in the footnotes is important, include it in the body text. If it’s not, leave it out. 
</div>

Any data tables should be included as data blocks, however you can also embed static html tables within a text box. These should only be used to present textual tables or for any small presentations of data that are not possible to do in a data block at the moment. 

<!-- gif this -->
You can create static html tables for presenting information that isn't embedded in a data block. However, remember that *all of the data* included or referred to in your content should be available (or createable) from the downloadable open data files.

<!-- [GLOSSARY LINKS]
[REPLACE SOME OF THIS WITH CONTENT RMD LINKS] -->

---

## Sign off

---

<div class="alert alert-dismissible alert-warning">
Only users with ‘approver’ [permissions](#Roles_and_permissions) (usually G6 or above) can sign off the release and methodology for publication.
</div>

---

### Releases

---

Once you’re happy with your release, you need to go to the sign off page and change their status in order to move them through the release pipeline.

There are three statuses:

1.	**In draft** (where the production team work on drafting the release)
2.	**Ready for higher review** (where the senior statistician checks over the release before approving)
3.	**Approved for publication** (after approval has been given, releases in this status will be published on their scheduled date)

---

### Methodology

---

Once you’re happy with your methodology, your approver can approve it to go live either immediately or with a release.

There are two statuses:

1.	**In draft** (where the production team work on drafting the release)
2.	**Approved for publication** (after approval has been given, releases in this status will be published either immediately or with a release)


---

### Errors and warnings

---

There's quite a few things to remember to do as you build your release so to help ensure you haven't missed anything a release checklist is also available via the sign off page

The checklist can be accessed by clicking to edit release status. 

Remember to check over it before you submit your release for approval as a release that has outstanding warnings on it will not be able to be published.

`r knitr::include_graphics("images/ees-release-checklist.PNG")`

---

### How to approve a release

---

Releases are approved via the sign off tab. The release date is also set during this stage of the process. All releases scheduled for a specific date will be published at 9:30am on that day. 

`r knitr::include_graphics("images/ees-approving-release.PNG")`

The approver has the ability to approve the release to be published on a specific date or to publish as soon as possible. Publishing as soon as possible is useful for publishing amendments to existing releases. 

<div class="alert alert-dismissible alert-info">
This page also gives you the expected release url which may be useful to know for other things, for example, sending to the web team to add to your gov.uk announcement page. 
</div>


---

### Next release expected

---

You also have the option to add a date for when the next release is expected. This will appear at the top of a release page and give users an idea of when to expect the next release in the publication series. You can provide the planned month and year of the next release within this publication. 

If this is added but then needs to be changed or removed later in the year it is easy to do so, by creating an amendment and setting a new next release expected date on sign-off.


---

## Pre-release access

Prior to each release going live the production team are also able to grant pre-release access to a named group of users 24 hours before it goes live. These users do not require full access to the whole admin service. They will be able to see preview versions of any releases they have been granted access to. 

This preview is only accessible for the 24 hours before the publication date, the emails may go out to users before then. We expect teams will continue to send an email at 09:30 on pre-release day, including any additional briefing and the link to the pre-release area. 

<div class="alert alert-dismissible alert-info">
Jobshare emails should not be sent invites for pre-release. The personal emails for the specific individuals should be used instead, as jobshare emails do not have active accounts with DfE to access EES.
</div>

<div class="alert alert-dismissible alert-danger">
Pre-release access via Explore Education Statistics is currently limited to DFE users only, if you need to share your release with external users you will need to do so outside of the system.

Inviting users for pre-release access and building the public pre-release list can be found within the ‘Pre-release access’ tab on the dashboard. 

Once the release has been marked as approved, go to the  ‘Pre-release access’ tab and add the relevant email addresses to grant pre-release access. All invited users will receive an email to say that they have been given pre-release access and will get a url where the preview release will be available. 

`r knitr::include_graphics("images/EES-invite-pra.PNG")`

You should also create the public facing pre-release access page by clicking the ‘Public access list’ tab.

`r knitr::include_graphics("images/EES-public-pra-list.PNG")`

After creating your pre-release access list a text editor will appear where you can list the roles that have been given early access to the release. This list will then appear in the list of file downloads at the top of each release. 

`r knitr::include_graphics("images/EES-create-public-pra-list.PNG")`

# Release amendments

---

If you need to make an amendment to release that has already been published this is possible to do from within the admin dashboard if you are a publication owner. If you need to create an amendment and your publication owner is not available, please contact the Statistics Development Team to do this for you.

`r knitr::include_graphics("images/EES-amend-release.PNG")`

Creating an amendment of a release will create a new version for which you can make any changes and then choose to republish, either as soon as possible or on a given date. 

---

## Release notes

---

When publishing a new amendment you should add a 'release note' to your release so users can be informed of what has changed:

`r knitr::include_graphics("images/EES-release-note.PNG")`



---

# Methodology

---

Methodologies work in a very similar way to the written content of a release, the text editor and static tables you can use are built on the same foundations. 

If you have not created or published a methodology page on EES before, the first thing your publication owner will need to do is create a methodology page. 

`r knitr::include_graphics("images/EES-create-methodology.PNG")`

Once created you can then edit the methodology content in a similar way to how you would create release page content. 

Once the drafting has finished, notify your approver. When they approve, your approver can either set your methodology to go live immediately, or set it to be published alongside a particular release.

If you want to revise an existing methodology page, you can amend the methodology, which will generate a new version for you to edit. 

`r knitr::include_graphics("images/EES-amend-methodology.PNG")`

Once you're happy with your amendment it just needs to be [approved](#Sign_off) in the usual way for it to be published. 

---

## Methodology formatting

---

Subheadings make it easier for your users to navigate through your methodology. When editing text blocks in your methodology, you can do this by highlighting your subheading and selecting "Heading 3" in place of "Paragraph":

`r knitr::include_graphics("images/methodology_subheadings.PNG")`

You can add further subheadings underneath this but try to limit the number of subheadings per accordion to 10 at the most. Too many subheadings will make it tricky for users to find what they are looking for. 

---

## Methodology images

---

You can add images to methodology pages via the content editor.

`r knitr::include_graphics("images/ees-wysiwyg-images.png")`

When uploading an image you will need to add alt text via by clicking the eye symbol, you may also choose to add an image caption.

`r knitr::include_graphics("images/ees-wysiwyg-alt-text.PNG")`

<div class="alert alert-dismissible alert-info">
Accessibility matters for uploaded images too, consider the following if you do need to upload an image - 

* Keep them simple
* Use [GDS colours](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/styles/colour/)
* Don't put borders around images
* Ensure there is a high enough colour contrast ratio between elements. You can use a [colour contrast checker](https://contrast-checker.glitch.me/) to check the colours you're using
* Try to avoid adding text to your images other than axis labels and limited annotations.

# Managing publications

---

We have a type of role within EES admin called ‘Publication Owner’. This permissions level gives publication owners control over their publications. 

Options available to publication owners:

`r knitr::include_graphics("images/publicationowner-options.png")`


---

## Publication management

---

Use this page to change the details for your publication, such as the contact information or to add links to legacy releases on gov.uk. 

Any updates here will affect all releases in the series and will be published immediately. 

<div class="alert alert-dismissible alert-danger">
Only BAU Users (the Statistics Development Team) can amend publication titles, however this should only be requested rarely and will not affect the publications url if one or more published releases exist. 
</div>

`r knitr::include_graphics("images/manage-publication.png")`

---

## Create new release

---

After finding the publication you want to create a release for, just press the button to create a new release. 

Currently the following types of release can be created in EES: 

* National Statistics (includes OSR tick mark logo at the top of the release page)  
* Official Statistics
* Adhoc Statistics

When creating a release you will be asked to fill in some release summary fields.

<div class="alert alert-dismissible alert-info">
The time period for the release should reflect the time period of the data that this latest release adds to the time series.
</div>

---

## Managing legacy releases

---

Past publications on other services can be added to the previous releases links that appear on the top right of a release page by using the 'Manage legacy releases' section. In here you can add links to previous releases and choose the order in which they appear. 

This section can be found by publication owners in the publication management section.

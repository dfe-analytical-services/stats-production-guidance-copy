<h1 class="title toc-ignore">Using Explore Education Statistics</h1>

</div>


<p class="text-muted">
Guidance for how to use the features in the Explore Education Statistics platform
</p>
<hr />
<p>Explore Education Statistics (EES) is the Department’s official statistics dissemination platform, designed to make DFE’s published statistics and data easier to find, access, use and understand.</p>
<p><strong>The EES platform consists of two applications:</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>The <a href="https://explore-education-statistics.service.gov.uk/">public</a> website, where users access stats</p></li>
<li><p>The <a href="https://admin.explore-education-statistics.service.gov.uk/">admin</a> website, where production teams create their stats</p></li>
</ol>
<div class="alert alert-dismissible alert-info">
<p>The majority of the admin side of EES is only supported in Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge and will not work correctly in Internet Explorer. The public website and pre-release previews of releases in admin can be viewed using Internet Explorer, though we still recommend that people use Chrome or Edge instead.</p>
</div>
<p>Both applications were released to Minimal Viable Product (MVP) standard in March 2020, we will be iterating and improving the functionality based on user feedback throughout 2020 and 2021.</p>
<p>Maintenance and use of the platform is supported by the <a href="mailto:explore.statistics@education.gov.uk">Statistics Development Team</a>.</p>
<hr />
<div id="accessing-ees" class="section level1">
<h1>Accessing EES</h1>
<hr />
<div id="environments" class="section level2">
<h2>Environments</h2>
<hr />
<p>As stated above, EES consists of two parts. We also have four versions (environments) of EES, the banner for the admin part of each environment will inform you which environment you are on, this is also colour coded:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Development</strong> - Green - where changes are first merged in, and often the first time different pieces of work from different developers will interact properly</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Test</strong> - Pink - where our developers can carry out manual testing of any new features to make sure things work as expected</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Pre-production</strong> - Yellow - a sandbox area for analysts to carry out functionality testing</p>
<p>Admin pre-production - <a href="https://admin.pre-production.explore-education-statistics.service.gov.uk" class="uri">https://admin.pre-production.explore-education-statistics.service.gov.uk</a></p>
<p>Public pre-production - <a href="https://pre-production.explore-education-statistics.service.gov.uk" class="uri">https://pre-production.explore-education-statistics.service.gov.uk</a></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Production</strong> - Red - the real service, anyone creating real releases that they intend to publish to the public should be using this environment</p>
<p>Admin - <a href="https://admin.explore-education-statistics.service.gov.uk" class="uri">https://admin.explore-education-statistics.service.gov.uk</a></p>
<p>Public - <a href="https://explore-education-statistics.service.gov.uk" class="uri">https://explore-education-statistics.service.gov.uk</a></p></li>
</ul>
<p>There is no overlap between the environments and content created on one cannot be moved to any other.</p>
<div class="alert alert-dismissible alert-danger">
<p>If you are bookmarking links, please be careful to bookmark the links below exactly as they are shown. Often when signing in you will be redirected via other url’s as a part of the authentication process, and bookmarking those may lead to errors.</p>
</div>
<p>Teams can use the pre-production environment to familiarise themselves with the platform and test out what is possible. The core functionality across the environments is identical except for new changes, which are deployed through the different environments before they make it to production.</p>
<p>On the pre-production environment, all analysts have full permissions to create publications and releases, and can see everything else that other analysts are making. This is unique to the pre-production environment, on the production environment analysts will only have access to releases that they have been granted specific access to.</p>
<p>When accessing the pre-production environment you may be asked for a username and password, these are as follows: dfe, dataresearch.</p>
<div class="alert alert-dismissible alert-danger">
<p>The pre-production environment is not suitable for unpublished data. Unpublished data should only be uploaded to the production environment.</p>
</div>
<div id="getting-access-to-admin" class="section level3">
<h3>Getting access to admin</h3>
<p>Access to the production and pre-production admin services is limited to DfE AD accounts only and users have to have been invited to the service by either the Statistics Development Team (for full access) or an existing user (for pre-release access). Invites to the service are sent out via email using gov.uk Notify.</p>
<p>To be invited to the service for full access teams need to email the <a href="mailto:explore.statistics@education.gov.uk">Explore Statistics Mailbox</a>, stating who needs access, what permissions they require (analyst or approver), and for which publications these apply. This email should be sent by the Team Leader, or accompanied with the relevant Team Leader’s approval. Once access has been granted you will receive an email inviting you to use the platform.</p>
<div class="alert alert-dismissible alert-info">
<p>Jobshare emails can not be used to access EES. Specific personal emails should be used instead, in the same way as you sign in to windows on your machine.</p>
</div>
<hr />
</div>
</div>
<div id="roles-and-permissions" class="section level2">
<h2>Roles and permissions</h2>
<hr />
<!-- need to include methodologies in this section? -->
<p>The Statistics Development Team are responsible for setting up and maintaining user permissions during the beta phase. Change requests will be monitored via their main mailbox - <a href="mailto:explore.statistics@education.gov.uk" class="email">explore.statistics@education.gov.uk</a>.</p>
<p>The following roles exist within EES admin and are assigned to a specific release:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Pre-release</strong></p>
<p>Any user invited for pre-release is given a pre-release user role. During the hours of pre-release they can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Preview the release page, including downloading files</li>
<li>Preview the table tool page for that release</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Analyst - contributor</strong></p>
<p>Any analyst working on a release within EES admin will have the contributor role. They can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Edit release details</li>
<li>Upload data and other files</li>
<li>Create footnotes, datablocks and charts</li>
<li>Edit and comment on release content</li>
<li>Invite PRA users</li>
<li>Move the release status between draft and ready for higher review</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Analyst - approver</strong></p>
<p>The responsible statistician for a statistics release will have the approver role, allowing them to sign off releases for publication. This will usually be the responsible G5 or G6 for the statistics publication. They can do everything a contributor can, as well as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Move the release status between draft, ready for review and approved</li>
<li>Schedule the release for publication (either immediately or for a specific date)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p>There is also a publication owner role, which is assigned at publication level to a users account:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Publication owner</strong></p>
<p>This permissions level gives publication owners control over their publications. They can do anything a contributor can for all releases within the publication. On top of this the publication owner also has access to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Manage publication level details</li>
<li>Create new releases within a publication</li>
<li>Create an amendment of the latest published release within a publication</li>
<li>Cancel an amendment before it is published</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>BAU</strong></p>
<p>The administrative role:</p>
<ul>
<li>This role is assigned to a user and gives full access including administrative tools, typically only used by the Statistics Development Team and EES developers.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>See below for a diagram of the responsibilities of each role as part of the publication process in EES:</p>
<p><img src="images/EES_roles.svg" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<hr />
</div>
<div id="requesting-a-new-publication" class="section level2">
<h2>Requesting a new publication</h2>
<hr />
<p>If you have not published on EES before, or if you’re creating a brand new publication, you will need to contact us to create the publication for you before you can get started.</p>
<p>The hierarchy of content within EES is as follows -</p>
<p><img src="images/ees-hierarchy.PNG" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>Publications are organised into topics and themes (as shown on the EES <a href="https://explore-education-statistics.service.gov.uk/find-statistics">Find Statistics page</a>), and then within each publication there are releases - where the latest release includes the latest statistics for that publication. For example:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th align="left">Level</th>
<th align="left">Example</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td align="left">Theme</td>
<td align="left">Pupils and Schools</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td align="left">Topic</td>
<td align="left">Pupil absence</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td align="left">Publication</td>
<td align="left">Pupil absence in schools in England</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td align="left">Release</td>
<td align="left">2018/19</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Each publication should have a lead statistician’s name and contact details attached to it as a requirement of the Code of Practice. You may use a team email address but the name and telephone number of a named statistician should also be provided.</p>
<p>Methodology documentation is also attached at a publication level within EES - meaning one standalone piece should be written to cover all releases for the given publication within the service.</p>
<p>If you want to request a new publication, please be prepared to give the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The heading and subheading that you want the publication to sit under in our site (take a look at the current structure <a href="https://explore-education-statistics.service.gov.uk/find-statistics" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>), feel free to either use existing ones, or suggest new ones</li>
<li>The exact title of the publication</li>
<li>A summary of less than 160 characters (including spaces) that describes your publication series</li>
<li>If the methodology already exists elsewhere and you have a URL for it, or if you want to <a href="#Methodology">create one</a></li>
<li>Team name</li>
<li>Team email address</li>
<li>Lead statistician name</li>
<li>Lead statistician contact number</li>
<li>The <a href="ud.html#List_of_allowable_time_values">time period</a> of the release you’re creating</li>
<li>Whether they are National statistics, an ad-hoc publication, or official statistics</li>
<li>List of email addresses of analysts who need access to the release and at what <a href="#Roles_and_permissions">permission levels</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Publication details can be <a href="#Publication_management">managed by publication owners</a> or via requests to the <a href="mailto:explore.statistics@education.gov.uk">Explore Statistics Mailbox</a>.</p>

<h2>Admin dashboard</h2>
<hr />
<div class="alert alert-dismissible alert-warning">
<p>Use Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge to access and use the admin part of Explore Education Statistics.</p>
</div>
<p>When you enter the service you’ll see the admin dashboard, here what you can see will be dependent on your access permissions i.e. you’ll only see the publications that you have been granted access to. Within the test environment users are set up with full permissions (i.e. they can see/do everything) though in our production environment this will be restricted.</p>
<p>The Statistics Development Team will be responsible for setting up and maintaining user permissions during the beta phase. Change requests will be monitored via their EES mailbox - <a href="mailto:explore.statistics@education.gov.uk" class="email">explore.statistics@education.gov.uk</a>.</p>
<p><img src="images/EES-admin-dashboard.PNG" /><!-- --></p>

<div id="external-user-access" class="section level2">
<h2>External user access</h2>
<hr />
<p>Access to EES for users outside of DfE is difficult as the authentication and security on the service relies on the DfE Azure Active Directory and associated infrastructure. It is possible to request that external users from other government organisations have access, and they can then be added as collaborating analysts on a release or as pre-release viewers.</p>
<p>If you have external users you’d like to request access for, please send the following to <a href="mailto:explore.statistics@education.gov.uk" class="email">explore.statistics@education.gov.uk</a>, <em>at least two weeks</em> in advance of requiring access. Due to the dependency on DfE’s digital security we cannot guarantee access or how long it may take.</p>

<p>New releases can be <a href="#Create_new_release">created by publication owners</a> or via requests to the <a href="mailto:explore.statistics@education.gov.uk">Explore Statistics Mailbox</a>. If you’re requesting a new release via the mailbox, please give the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Name of the publication (including theme and topic that it sits under)</li>
<li>Time period for the release</li>
<li><a href="ud.html#List_of_allowable_time_values">Time identifier</a> for the release</li>
<li>Type of release (National, Official, Ad-hoc etc)</li>

<h2>Data and files</h2>
<hr />
<p>Here you will update your data files and accompanying metadata. You need to make sure that the data has passed through our <a href="https://rsconnect/rsc/dfe-published-data-qa/">data screener checks</a> before trying to upload it.</p>
<div class="alert alert-dismissible alert-info">
<p>All data files are accessible in the downloadable files for users to explore in the same format as they are uploaded.</p>
</div>
<hr />
<div id="subject-titles" class="section level3">
<h3>Subject titles</h3>
<hr />
<p>You’ll need to give a ‘subject title’ to each data file you upload. The subject name should be a simple user-friendly title for the data included within the file - it is what users will see wherever the file is referenced within EES. The actual file name and data guidance can include more technical / coverage information.</p>
<p>When adding a subject name think about the general user and how the subjects will appear in the service:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>You don’t need to include the publication name in the subject name as this is always already implied within EES</p></li>
<li><p>You don’t need to list what filters are in each file in the title, users can see this in the data guidance</p></li>
<li><p>You don’t need to include the date ranges covered in each file in the title, users can see this in the data guidance</p></li>
<li><p>Your subject names should be short and snappy, clearly explain what is in each file. Some good examples of this in practice are included below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Early years provision by provider type</li>
<li>Exclusions and suspensions by pupil characteristics</li>
<li>ITT new entrants by subject and training route</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>You can make changes the subject title for your data file after it has been uploaded if needed using the ‘Edit title’ option.</p>
<hr />
</div>
<div id="uploading-files" class="section level3">
<h3>Uploading files</h3>
<hr />
<p>When uploading files you have a choice between uploading as separate CSV files or as a combined ZIP file.</p>
<p>For data files greater than 80mb we recommend uploading as a ZIP file.</p>
<p>Once you click to upload the file a ‘Status’ will be visible that shows the progress of the import process. It will go through the following stages:</p>
<ul>
<li>Queued</li>
<li>Validating</li>
<li>Importing</li>
<li>Complete</li>
</ul>
<p>This may take a little while depending on the size of your file and if there are numerous files queued for import. You cannot view the dataset or use it to create tables/charts until this status is ‘COMPLETE’.</p>
<div class="alert alert-dismissible alert-warning">
<p>If you believe your file is ‘stuck’ please contact <a href="mailto:explore.statistics@education.gov.uk" class="email">explore.statistics@education.gov.uk</a>, with details of the file and the release that you are uploading to.</p>

<div id="ordering-filters-and-indicators" class="section level3">
<h3>Ordering filters and indicators</h3>
<hr />
<p>To save time when creating tables and charts, and to aid users who view your data themselves via the table tool, you can now save custom orders for your filters and indicators. You can do this in the data and files page after uploading underlying data files, via the ‘reorder filters and indicators’ tab. Once there just choose which file you want to reorder and then click and drag the items until they’re in the order you want them to show in the table tool. This then becomes the default order for this filter or indicator and will apply in all charts and tables automatically.</p>

</div>
<div id="ancillary-file-uploads" class="section level3">
<h3>Ancillary file uploads</h3>
<hr />
<p>Any files you want to make available for users to download but aren’t intended the table tool should be added as an ancillary file upload. These files will need to meet all requirements of the new <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/publishing-accessible-documents">accesibility regulations</a> before they can be published.</p>
<p>Examples of ancillary files may be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Infographic pages</li>
<li>Supplementary data that isn’t intended for the table tool</li>
<li>Additional technical documentation</li>
</ul>
<p>For ensuring that spreadsheets are accessible see the guidance from <a href="https://gov.wales/how-create-accessible-excel-spreadsheets">.gov.wales</a>, and this <a href="https://gss.civilservice.gov.uk/blog/accessibility-empathy-for-users-of-spreadsheets/">blog post</a> that walks you through some ways that you can recreate the experience of using spreadsheets.</p>
<div class="alert alert-dismissible alert-info">
<p>Any data files that only consist of Planning area, and/or Institution level data should be uploaded as an ancillary file, rather than as a data file.</p>

</div>
<div id="public-data-guidance" class="section level3">
<h3>Public data guidance</h3>
<hr />
<p>Here you should also create your <a href="https://explore-education-statistics.service.gov.uk/find-statistics/permanent-and-fixed-period-exclusions-in-england/meta-guidance">public data guidance</a> document, this replaces the information that would have previously been uploaded as a pdf and is designed to help users understand and use the data they download from your release.</p>
<p><img src="images/admin-public-meta-start.PNG" /><!-- --></p>
<p>The document will automatically update as you add new data files to your release, however you will need to add an overview of all the data included in the release and short summaries for each data file before the release can be published.</p>
<p>A list of variables in each file with an associated label (taken from metadata uploads) and associated footnotes will also be displayed for each file.</p>
<p><img src="images/admin-public-meta-detail.PNG" /><!-- --></p>

<div id="replacing-data" class="section level3">
<h3>Replacing data</h3>
<hr />
<p>If you just need to change the subject title for your data file you do not need to go through the whole replacement process, just click the ‘Edit title’ option.</p>
<p>However, if you notice a mistake in your data file you can replace it with another. When replacing a data file the platform will attempt to recreate any data blocks and footnotes that were built using the previous file.</p>
<div class="alert alert-dismissible alert-warning">
<p>The replacement file must contain the exact same column names and types as the original. For example, a character column named “date” must also be replaced with a character column named “date”. A numeric column named “date” will not work in the replacement.</p>
</div>
<p><img src="images/replace-data-start.png" /><!-- --></p>
<p>The first step is to upload the new file.</p>
<p><img src="images/replace-data-step1.PNG" /><!-- --></p>
<p>One you’ve chosen and uploaded your replacement file it will need to go through the usual import process before it can check if retaining existing data blocks and footnotes will be possible.</p>
<p><img src="images/replace-data-step2.PNG" /><!-- --></p>
<p>Once the upload is finished a report will appear which highlights whether existing data blocks and footnotes can be replaced successfully. If you want to keep any data blocks and footnotes you’ve built you will need to make sure that your replacement data file still contains the information (indicators, filters, geographic_levels and time_periods) that was used to create them.</p>
<p><img src="images/replace-data-success.PNG" /><!-- --></p>
<p>If it’s not possible for a data block or footnote to be recreated using the replacing data file a warning will appear and you’ll be prompted to either edit or delete them before completing the replacement.</p>
<p><img src="images/replace-data-fail.PNG" /><!-- --></p>
<div class="alert alert-dismissible alert-danger">
<p>Remember to double check any data blocks or footnotes that were recreated by the platform before publishing your release.</p>
</div>
<hr />
</div>
</div>
<div id="footnotes" class="section level2">
<h2>Footnotes</h2>
<hr />
<p>Footnotes are added via footnotes tab - rather than writing multiple tables and assigning individual footnotes, you write footnotes and assign them to certain indicators and filters so they appear when users select them in the table builder. For example in the below, the footnote “This is a footnote” is assigned to “Headcount” indicator for all options within the “School type” filter.</p>
<p><img src="images/footnote_example.PNG" /><!-- --></p>
<p>If you’d rather, you can assign a footnote to the whole data file by ticking this box.</p>
<p><img src="images/All_indicators.PNG" /><!-- --></p>
<p>You can assign the same footnote across multiple data files.</p>
<div class="alert alert-dismissible alert-danger">
<p>We recommend that you only add footnotes once you are certain the data file is final. If you have to delete the data file, all the assigned footnotes will be deleted alongside it.</p>

<div id="data-blocks-tables-and-charts" class="section level2">
<h2>Data blocks (tables and charts)</h2>
<hr />
<p>A data block is a smaller cut of data from your original file that you can embed into your publication as a presentation table, build charts from, or link users directly to.</p>
<hr />
<div id="tables" class="section level3">
<h3>Tables</h3>
<hr />
<p>Here you can create data blocks, using the admin table tool to create and save your summary tables. Remember to use the reorder table headers tool to restructure your table however you want it before you save.</p>
<p>Once you’re happy with your table, give it a title and some source information before clicking save. The source should be the source of the data used to create the data file that was then used for the data block table, for example ‘School Census’.</p>
<p>The manage data blocks page will list all the data blocks you have created, highlighting which have charts, are used in content and are saved as highlight tables.</p>
<p><img src="images/ees-manage-data-blocks.PNG" /><!-- --></p>
<hr />
<div id="featured-tables" class="section level4">
<h4>Featured tables</h4>
<hr />
<p>You can also choose to highlight a data block table as a ‘featured table’ which means it will show in a list of featured tables within the table tool. This is designed to help users get to tables of interest more quickly (without having to create tables themselves).</p>
<p>There is an option to choose if a table is a ‘featured table’ when saving each data block, here you can name the table and add a description giving the table coverage:</p>
<p><img src="images/EES-create-release-table-highlight.PNG" /><!-- --></p>
<p>Each featured table will then be listed to the user within the table tool. Featured tables do not have to be embedded within your release content to be included in this list.</p>
<p><img src="images/EES-table-tool-highlights.PNG" /><!-- --></p>
<hr />
</div>
<div id="fast-track-links" class="section level4">
<h4>Fast track links</h4>
<hr />
<p>Any data block tables that are created and saved within the admin app will also be assigned a ‘fast-track link’, this url can then be used throughout your release as a way to direct users to specific tables (within the table tool) more quickly so they can interact and explore the data further. It will appear at the top of the page like this:</p>
<p><img src="images/EES-create-release-fasttrack-url.PNG" /><!-- --></p>
<p>When your release is published, any embedded data block tables within the release will have an ‘explore data button’ beneath them which will utilise these fast track links to quickly direct users to the table within the table tool so they can explore the data further. You can also use fast-track links as a hyperlink within release commentary (without having to embed the data block).</p>
<p>In your fast-track titles, you don’t want to overload information, but still want to direct the user to the right place. Remember they can go back to the table tool through your featured tables to change filters and indicators as needed.</p>
<p>Fast-track titles should explain:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>What</strong> the table is showing in the simplest terms</li>
<li><strong>Who/Where</strong> the data covers (e.g. characteristic groups and geography levels)</li>
<li><strong>When</strong> the data in the table is reported for</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are a few examples of good fast-track titles in EES:</p>
<ul>
<li>Number of Schools and Pupils, by School Type, 2015/16 to 2020/21</li>
<li>Absence Rates by School Type, 2016/17 to 2020/21</li>
<li>Free School Meals, by Region, 2015/16 to 2020/21</li>
</ul>
<div class="alert alert-dismissible alert-info">
<p><strong>What is the difference between a fast-track link and a permalink?</strong></p>
<p>EES also offers ‘permalinks’ for any table created in the table tool which allows a user to save a link to a permanent, static, version of a table they have created. Analysts can make use of these permalinks when answering queries or in PQ and FOI responses.</p>
<p>Fast-track links are similar to permalinks however instead of linking to a static version of a table they link to an ‘active’ version of the table within the table tool - meaning users can interact and change what’s shown in the table from within the table tool if they choose to.</p>

<div id="charts" class="section level3">
<h3>Charts</h3>
<hr />
<p>After building and saving a data block table you will see a ‘Chart’ tab appears. This tab will take you to the EES chart builder, where you can choose to add a chart to your data block.</p>
<p>The first step to creating a chart is choosing the chart type, currently the EES chart builder can build line charts, horizontal/vertical bar charts (including stacked and clustered) and maps.</p>
<p>After choosing your chart type you then need to work through the following stages to build your chart. In each stage you’ll be shown a live preview as you make changes.</p>

<div id="chart-configuration" class="section level4">
<h4>Chart configuration</h4>

<p>Infographic alternatives should be .svg format and you can use the sizing options within the data block editor to size your image appropriately.</p>
<div class="alert alert-dismissible alert-info">
<p>Accessibility matters for infographics too, consider the following if you do need to upload an image -</p>
<ul>
<li>Keep them simple</li>
<li>Use colours that are available in EES - see our <a href="cd.html#Charts-in-EES">visualisation guidance</a> for more details</li>
<li>Don’t put borders around images</li>
<li>Read the <a href="https://analysisfunction.civilservice.gov.uk/policy-store/data-visualisation-colours-in-charts/">GSS guidance on the use of colour in visualisations</a> and follow the steps provided to check your visualisations</li>
<li>Try to avoid adding text to your images other than axis labels and limited annotations. Titles and headings can be added in the “chart configuration” tab instead</li>

<p>You can use the page view toggles, that float in the bottom left of the page, to jump between edit and preview mode for the release and to view a preview of the table tool.</p>

<p>Use the ‘Add secondary stats’ button to add a data block to your headline stats section.</p>
<p>Use the ‘Key stats’ options to add key statistic tiles to your release. For each tile you first have to have created a data block that contains only one number.</p>
<p><img src="images/key-stat.PNG" /><!-- --></p>
<p>After embedding a key stat tile you can then edit it to add trend information and a description of what the indicator is.</p>

<h3>Drafting text</h3>

<div class="alert alert-dismissible alert-info">
<p>Do not use footnotes in the text of your content. They’re designed for reference in print, not web pages. If the information in the footnotes is important, include it in the body text. If it’s not, leave it out.</p>
</div>
<p>Any data tables should be included as data blocks, however you can also embed static html tables within a text box. These should only be used to present textual tables or for any small presentations of data that are not possible to do in a data block at the moment.</p>
<!-- gif this -->
<p>You can create static html tables for presenting information that isn’t embedded in a data block. However, remember that <em>all of the data</em> included or referred to in your content should be available (or createable) from the downloadable open data files.</p>
<p>While a release is in draft mode, comments can be added to text to help teams collaborate. Simply highlight the text you want to comment on and click on the speech bubble in the editing bar to add a comment.</p>
<p><img src="images/comment.png" /><!-- --></p>
<p>Comments can be edited at a later date, and can also be marked as resolved so that you can see which comments have been addressed and which are still outstanding.</p>
<p>When someone is editing a text box, it will now be instantly frozen for all other users preventing two users from editing the same block of text at the same time. You will be able to see the name of the user who is making edits, and will see the edits coming through every few seconds as their changes autosave.</p>

<h2>Embedding R-Shiny blocks</h2>
<hr />
<p>If you need to include a type of chart that isn’t possible using the standard EES chart options, for example an interactive chart with filters, you can embed a block to display a custom R-Shiny produced chart.</p>
<p>To embed a shiny chart, you’ll first need to create an R-Shiny application containing the chart using the DfE tiny-shiny template and get it hosted on our DfE GitHub and ShinyApps accounts. More details on both of these are available in the tiny-shiny section of this guidance.</p>
<p>Once you’ve got the R-Shiny app set up and hosted, you can embed it using the <strong>Add embed block</strong> button in the content area. This will give you the option to enter a URL, where you can enter the URL of the shiny app. Valid URLs to use in the embed block dialogue box are limited to only those on the DfE ShinyApps server (and the internal rsconnect when needed for draft publications).</p>

<h2>Glossary</h2>
<hr />
<p>Our glossary on EES is a growing page that helps us to standardise how refer to key terms and phrases across all of Official statistics - <a href="https://explore-education-statistics.service.gov.uk/glossary" class="uri">https://explore-education-statistics.service.gov.uk/glossary</a>.</p>
<hr />
<div id="adding-new-definitions" class="section level3">
<h3>Adding new definitions</h3>
<hr />
<p>Contact us at <a href="mailto:explore.statistics@education.gov.uk" class="email">explore.statistics@education.gov.uk</a>, with the title and definition and we can add this for you. It’s worth having a check on the glossary for similar or related terms, and whether you should be looking to harmonise with other teams.</p>
<hr />
</div>
<div id="linking-to-definitions" class="section level3">
<h3>Linking to definitions</h3>
<hr />
<p>You can link to any term in the glossary by appending the glossary url with #name-of-definition, replacing any spaces with hyphens.</p>
<p>For example, to link to the definition for ‘Respite care’, you would use the following link:</p>
<p><a href="https://explore-education-statistics.service.gov.uk/glossary#respite-care" class="uri">https://explore-education-statistics.service.gov.uk/glossary#respite-care</a></p>
<p>You can test this works by typing the url into your browser, it should take you to that specific definition on the glossary page. If you’re unsure at all, or have special characters in the title of your glossary entry, please ask us for support on getting the right link.</p>
<hr />
</div>
<div id="linking-from-your-release" class="section level3">
<h3>Linking from your release</h3>
<hr />
<p>When writing your release content, highlight a word or phrase and click the link icon in the text editor bar.</p>
<p><img src="images/ees-glossary-texteditor.PNG" /><!-- --></p>
<p>Then, paste your glossary url into the box that appears.</p>
<p><img src="images/ees-glossary-paste.PNG" /><!-- --></p>
<p>That’s it, the system will automatically recognise that the link is for the glossary and will do the rest. You can then change to the preview mode to see how this would then appear to public users, and test that the box appears with the definition.</p>

<div id="sign-off" class="section level2">
<h2>Sign off</h2>
<hr />
<p>Once you’re happy with your release you need to go to the sign off page and change it’s status in order to move it through the release pipeline.</p>
<p>There are three statuses:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>In draft</strong> (where the production team work on drafting the release)</li>
<li><strong>Ready for higher review</strong> (where the senior statistician checks over the release before approving)</li>
<li><strong>Approved for publication</strong> (after approval has been given, releases in this status will be published on their scheduled date)</li>
</ol>
<div class="alert alert-dismissible alert-warning">
<p>Only users with ‘approver’ permissions(#Roles_and_permissions) (usually G6 or above) can sign off the release for publication.</p>
</div>
<hr />
<div id="errors-and-warnings" class="section level3">
<h3>Errors and warnings</h3>
<hr />
<p>There’s quite a few things to remember to do as you build your release so to help ensure you haven’t missed anything a release checklist is also available via the sign off page</p>
<p>The checklist can be accessed by clicking to edit release status.</p>
<p>Remember to check over it before you submit your release for approval as a release that has outstanding warnings on it will not be able to be published.</p>

</div>
<div id="how-to-approve-a-release" class="section level3">
<h3>How to approve a release</h3>
<hr />
<p>Releases are approved via the sign off tab. The release date is also set during this stage of the process. All releases scheduled for a specific date will be published at 9:30am on that day.</p>
<p><img src="images/ees-approving-release.PNG" /><!-- --></p>
<p>The approver has the ability to approve the release to be published on a specific date or to publish as soon as possible. Publishing as soon as possible is useful for publishing amendments to existing releases.</p>
<div class="alert alert-dismissible alert-info">
<p>This page also gives you the expected release url which may be useful to know for other things, for example, sending to the web team to add to your gov.uk announcement page.</p>

</div>
<div id="next-release-expected" class="section level3">
<h3>Next release expected</h3>
<hr />
<p>You also have the option to add a date for when the next release is expected. This will appear at the top of a release page and give users an idea of when to expect the next release in the publication series. You can provide the planned month and year of the next release within this publication.</p>
<p>If this is added but then needs to be changed or removed later in the year it is easy to do so, by creating an amendment and setting a new next release expected date on sign-off.</p>
<hr />
</div>
</div>
<div id="pre-release-access" class="section level2">
<h2>Pre-release access</h2>
<hr />
<p>Prior to each release going live the production team are also able to grant pre-release access to a named group of users 24 hours before it goes live. These users do not require full access to the whole admin service. They will be able to see preview versions of any releases they have been granted access to.</p>
<p>This preview is only accessible for the 24 hours before the publication date, the emails may go out to users before then. We expect teams will continue to send an email at 09:30 on pre-release day, including any additional briefing and the link to the pre-release area.</p>
<div class="alert alert-dismissible alert-info">
<p>Jobshare emails should not be sent invites for pre-release. The personal emails for the specific individuals should be used instead, as jobshare emails do not have active accounts with DfE to access EES.</p>
</div>
<div class="alert alert-dismissible alert-danger">
<p>Pre-release access via Explore Education Statistics is currently limited to DFE users only, if you need to share your release with external users you will need to do so outside of the system.</p>

<h1>Methodology</h1>

<p>Methodologies work in a very similar way to the written content of a release, the text editor and static tables you can use are built on the same foundations.</p>
<p>If you have not created or published a methodology page on EES before, the first thing your publication owner will need to do is create a methodology page.</p>
<p><img src="images/EES-create-methodology.PNG" /><!-- --></p>
<p>Once created you can then edit the methodology content in a similar way to how you would create release page content.</p>
<p>Methodologies should follow our recommended <a href="resources/Methodology%20template%20EES.docx">methodology template</a>, to ensure all the essential details are covered.</p>
<p>Once the drafting has finished, a methodology should be set as ‘approved for publication’, currently approved methodology changes will be published immediately so make sure you are ready for the changes to go live before approving.</p>
<p>If you want to revise an existing methodology page you can amend the methodology which will generate a new version for you to edit.</p>
<p><img src="images/EES-amend-methodology.PNG" /><!-- --></p>

<div id="methodology-formatting" class="section level2">
<h2>Methodology formatting</h2>

<p>Subheadings make it easier for your users to navigate through your methodology. When editing text blocks in your methodology, you can do this by highlighting your subheading and selecting “Heading 3” in place of “Paragraph”:</p>
<p><img src="images/methodology_subheadings.PNG" /><!-- --></p>
<p>You can add further subheadings underneath this but try to limit the number of subheadings per accordion to 10 at the most. Too many subheadings will make it tricky for users to find what they are looking for.</p>

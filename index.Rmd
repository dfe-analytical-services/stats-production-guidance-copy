This is a guide aimed at anyone producing official statistics. It is particularly important for those publishing using Explore Education Statistics (EES), though it also covers wider best practice and pulls together pieces of guidance that were previously standalone documents. If viewed in its entirety, it provides a walkthrough guide from processing to publication, as well as being a single reference point that is easy to navigate if you just need to check on a specific part of the process, link off to other resources, or access specific guidance.

Within this guide you can read about: 

* [Learning Resources](l+d.html)  
A collection of useful learning resources, and information on the recommended tools to get you started

* [Production Processes](rap.html)  
Guidance for how to implement the principles of Reproducible Analytical Pipelines (RAP) into our production proccesses

* [Data Standards](https://rsconnect/rsc/stats-production-guidance/ud.html)  
Guidance on how to structure data files

* [Writing and Visualising Statistics](cd.html)  
Things to consider when writing statistical commentary

* [Publishing Statistics](ees.html)  
Guidance for how to publish Official Statistics via the new Explore Education Statistics platform


In life there is generally little point to reinventing the wheel. There is already a wealth of resources out there, and therefore this site unashamedly aims to pool the revelant resources for statistics production into one place. There are some things that this site does not yet have, it will develop and change over time. We hope it can prove a useful resource for everyone from the most experienced of producers, right through to those who are working on their very first publication. If you have any feedback, suggested additions, or wish to challenge any of the guidance, please contact us using the envelope button in the top right corner.

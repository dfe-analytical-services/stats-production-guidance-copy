**This site**


This is a thing, that will contain many of the things needed to help guide statisticians in producing Official and National Statistics. It should be a neat way to give the analysts all of the information in a single place.


Worth shouting about the stats development team (us) as centralised support for teams? Could add a footer that explains who the team is, what we do (i.e. what we can help with) and contact details.

**What is on here**


Could provide a contents page to link off to the separate pages, also could add in some L+D (maybe worth it's own page? although often the links and resources are interwoven into the other sections, such as help with learning git is in the version control stuff), and point to anything useful, such as useful teams channels to be in? (well, as useful as any teams channel ever can be...).

**Design and purpose**


This is aimed as a guide for anyone producing official stats. It manages to provide a walkthrough guide from start to finish, as well as being easy to navigate if you just need to check on a specific part of the process.


Genuinely, follow each page from left to right in order, and it takes you through having a SQL server area set up for your data, through the analysis, QA, the standards and what you're aiming for in your files, how to check against those standards, then how to write content after you've produced the data, and then how to use the platform itself to publish your release and arrange pre-release access.


Obviously there are some things that this site does not have. It is likely to build and change over time. Hopefully it can prove a useful resource for everyone from the experience producers right through to those who are working on their very first publication.

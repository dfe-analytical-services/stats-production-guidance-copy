This is a guide aimed at anyone producing official statistics. It is particularly important for those publishing through EES, though it also covers wider best practice and pulls together pieces of guidance that were previously standalone documents. If viewed in its entirety, it provides a walkthrough guide from processing to publication, as well as being a single resource to refer to that is easy to navigate if you just need to check on a specific part of the process, or access specific guidance.

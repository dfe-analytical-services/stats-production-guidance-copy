**This site**

---

This is a thing, that will contain many of the things needed to help guide statisticians in producing Official and National Statistics. It should be a neat way to give the analysts all of the information in a single place.

Worth shouting about the stats development team (us) as centralised support for teams? Could add a footer that explains who the team is, what we do (i.e. what we can help with) and contact details.

**What is on here**

---

Make fancy tiles on here to link off to the separate pages, also add in some L+D (maybe worth it's own page? although often the links and resources are interwoven into the other sections, such as help with learning git is in the version control stuff), and point to anything useful, such as useful teams channels to be in? (well, as useful as any teams channel ever can be...).

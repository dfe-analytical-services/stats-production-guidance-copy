# What is RAP


---

[Reproducible Analytical Pipelines](https://dataingovernment.blog.gov.uk/2017/03/27/reproducible-analytical-pipeline/){target="_blank"}, or RAP for short. The full words still hide the true meaning behind buzzwords and jargon though. What it actually means is using automation to our advantage when analysing data, and this is as simple as writing code such as a SQL query that we can click a button to execute and do the job for us. 


We already have 'analytical pipelines' and have done for many years. The aim of RAP, is to automate the parts of these pipelines that can be automated, to increase efficiency and accuracy, while creating a clear audit trail to allow analyses to easily be re-run if needed. This will free us up to focus on the parts of our work where our human input can really add value. RAP is something we can use to reduce the burden on us by getting rid of some of the boring stuff, what's not to like!


---


### Our scope

---

We want to focus on the parts of the production process that we have ownership and control over – so we are focussing on the process from data sources to publishable data files. This is the part of the process where RAP can currently add the most value - automating the production and quality assurance of our outputs currently takes up huge amount of analytical resource, which could be better spent providing insight and other value adding activity. 

`r knitr::include_graphics("images/RAP-Scope-Arrow.png")`

In Official Statistics production we are using RAP as a framework for best practice when producing our published data files, as these are the foundations of our publications moving forward. Following this framework will help us to improve and standardise our current production processes and provide a clear 'pipeline' for analysts to follow. This will have the added benefit of setting a clear and defined world of tools and skills required, making learning and development that much clearer and easier. To get started with RAP, we first need to be able to understand what it actually means in practice, and be able to assess our own work against that - [assessing our work against RAP](#what-we-need-to-do).

Implementing RAP for us will involve combining the use of SQL, R, and clear, consistent version control to increase efficiency and accuracy in our work. For more information on what these tools are, why we are using them, and resources to help upskill in thoses areas, see - [what tools we will need to use](#tools-and-learning-resources).

The collection of, and routine checking of data as it is coming into the department is an area that RAP can be applied to. We have kept this out of scope at the moment as the levels of control in this area vary wildly from team to team. If you would like advice and help to automate any particular processes, feel free to contact us.

# What we need to do


---

<div class="alert alert-dismissible alert-danger">
<strong>Teams are expected to review their own processes and use the guidance on this site</strong> to start making improvements towards meeting the four core principles if they aren't already. If you would like additional help to review your processes, please contact the [Statistics Development Team](mailto:explore.statistics@education.gov.uk).
</div>


Teams will start from different places and implement changes at different rates, and in different ways. We do not expect that every team will follow the same path, or even end at the same point. Don't worry if this seems overwhelming at first, use the guidance here to identify areas for improvement and then tackle them with confidence.


<div class="alert alert-dismissible alert-secondary">
  <h2>Core principles</h2>

## Where we need to focus

---

Most teams have already made progress with their production of tidy data files, and the release of the automated screener has now tied up that end point of the pipeline that we are all currently working towards. The standard pipeline for all teams will roughly resemble this:


`r knitr::include_graphics("images/RAP-Process-Overview.png")`


The key now is for us to build on the work so far and focus on how we improve the quality and efficiency of our production processes up to that point. To do this, we need to make a concerted effort to standardise how we store and access our data, before then automating what we can to reduce the burden of getting the numbers ready and see the benefits of RAP. The exact meaning of this will vary within teams.


---


## RAP in practice

---

The diagram below highlights what RAP means for us, and the varying levels in which it can be applied. The general expectation is that all teams will have shifted towards the minimum implementation of RAP by the end of their next production cycle. It's worth acknowledging that some teams are already working around good and best practice levels.


`r knitr::include_graphics("images/RAP-in-practice.png")`

---

## Review checklists

---

Below are checklists designed to make reviewing our processes based on the graphic above easier, giving a straightforward list of quesitons to check our work against. This will flag areas that require improvement, and we can then use the links or sidebar to go to the specific section with more detail and guidance on how to get there.


Some teams will already be looking at best practice, while others will still have work to do to achieve good practice. We know that all teams are starting this from different points.

---

### Good practice

---

- Do we have a [sensible folder and file structure](#folder-structures)?


- Do we have suitable [documentation](#documentation)?


- Are our underlying data files [screened against the standards](#data-standards-screening)?


- Are all of our source data stored in a [single SQL database](#how-to-set-up-a-sql-working-area)?


- Do we produce our data with [no manual steps](#using-code-to-process-data-p4)?


- Do we have a clean final version of the code used to produce the data?


- Do we use the [basic level of automated QA](#automated-qa-p6)?

---

### Great practice

---

- Can the script that we used this year be used again next year with minimal alterations ( < 30 minutes of editing)?

- Do we have a [git-controlled repo](#how-to-setup-an-azure-devops-area) with final versions of code and documentation saved in it?

- Do we have the [data-screener setup](#data-standards-screening) and run within our team?

- Do we use a [single production script](#using-code-to-process-data-p4) to get from source data to underlying data?

- Do we use publication-specific [automated QA](#automated-qa-p6)?

- Do we use automation to produce [summary reports](#automating-summary-statistics) of our data?

---

### Best practice

---

- Do we actively use [git](#how-to-use-git-in-practice) when developing code?


- Do we have a single production script to get from source to underlying data, with intergrated QA and summary reports?

# Getting your data together in SQL

---

The first place to start for your teams RAP is to store the raw data you use to create underlying data in a Microsoft SQL Server database. This is similar to a sharepoint area or a shared folder, but it's a dedicated data storage area which allows multiple users to use the same file at once, and for you to run code against the data in one place.

---

### Introduction to SQL

---

SQL stands for Structured Query language and is a scripting language, which asks DfE servers to process data.


In order for us to be able to have an end-to-end data pipeline where we can replicate our analysis across the department, we should store all of the raw data needed to create aggregate statistics in a managed Microsoft SQL Server. This includes any lookup tables and all administrative data from collections prior to any manual processing. This allows us to then match and join the data together in an end-to-end process using SQL queries. 


SQL is a fantastic language for large scale data joining and manipulation; it allows us to replicate end-to-end from raw data to final aggregate statistics output. Having all the data in one place and processing it in one place makes our lives easier, and also helps us when auditing our work and ensuring reproducibility of results.

# Using code to process data

---


It is as simple as telling your computer what to do. Like in SPSS where you write the syntax. Talk about the benefits of it.

Any particular useful things to know, collate key tips such as using sensible variable names.

General good practice around writing code. [StyleR](https://styler.r-lib.org/){target="_blank"}, is a nifty package that helps you to standardise and style your R code in line with tidyverse formatting rules to make it easier to read and reuse for others.

### Producing tidy underlying data in SQL

---

[Data tidying tutorial in SQL](https://github.com/TomFranklin/sql-applied-data-tidying/blob/master/data_tidying_l_and_d.sql){target="_blank"}, this is a SQL query that you can run on your own machine and walks you through the basics of tidying a simple exmample dataset in SQL.

# Version control

---

Version control can mean a lot of things. Ultimately the aim should be to leave your work in a state that others (including future you!), can pick it up and immediately find what they need. Changes to files should be documented, and published versions should be clearly named and stored in their own folder. As we work with code to process our data more and more, we can begin to utilise version control software to make this process much easier, allowing simultaneous collaboration on files.

---

### Folder structures

---

How you organize and name your files will have a big impact on your ability to find those files later and to understand what they contain. You should be consistent and descriptive in naming and organizing files so that it is obvious where to find specific data and what the files contain.


As a minimum you should have a folder that includes all of the final versions of documents produced and published per release. Try asking yourself if it would be easy for someone who isn't in the team to find this folder, and if not, is there a better way that you could name and structure your folders to make them more intituitive to navigate?
 
---

### Naming conventions

---

Having a **clear** and **consistent** naming convention for your files is critical. Remember that file names should:


**Be machine readable** 

- Avoid spaces.
- Avoid special characters such as: ~ ! @ # $ % ^ & * ( ) ` ; < > ? , [ ] { } ‘ “.
- Be as short as practicable; overly long names do not work well with all types of software.


**Be human readable** 

- Be easy to understand the contents from the name.


**Play well with default ordering**

- Have numbers first.
- Follow the ISO 8601 date standard (YYYYMMDD) to ensure that all of your files stay in chronological order.
- Use leading zeros to left pad numbers and ensure files sort properly and avoid 1,10,2,3.


If in doubt, take a look at this [presentation](https://speakerdeck.com/jennybc/how-to-name-files){target="_blank"}, or this [naming convention guide by Stanford](https://library.stanford.edu/research/data-management-services/data-best-practices/best-practices-file-naming){target="_blank"}, for examples reinforcing the above.

---

#### EES naming conventions

---

Use the principles above to decide on a name for each data file and your wider publication. Then apply those to the following conventions. Remember that the general public will be using these.


| File | Name |
|------|------|
| Data | data_file.csv |
| Metadata (EES) | data_file.meta.csv |
| Metadata (external guidance) | publication_name.year.metadata.pdf |
| PRA list | publication_name.year.pra-list.pdf |
| Methodology (if not in the platform as .html or link) | publication_name.methodology.pdf |

### Documentation

---

_When you assume you make an 'ass' out of 'u' and 'me'_. Everyone knows this saying, yet not all of us heed it's warning. When documenting your processes you should leave nothing to chance, we all have wasted time in the past trying to work out what it was that we had done before, and that time increases even more when we are picking up someone elses work. Thorough documentation saves us time, and provides a clear audit trail of what we do.


You should be annotating as you go, ensuring that every process and decision made is written down. Take a look at your processes and be critical - could another analyst pick them up without you there to help them? If the answer is no (don't feel ashamed, it will be for many teams) then go through and highlight where y


An analyst from another area should be able to pick up your data and use your documentation to produce fully QA'd data files ready for publication. Teams may achieve this in different ways, as a guide we'd recommend that teams have:

- Document 1
- Document 2


Something around commenting in code and good practices there?


You might be thinking that it would be nice if there was software that could help you with documentation, if so, read on, as Git is an incredibly powerful tool that can help us easily and thoroughly document versions of our files.

# Automated QA

---

Any data files that have been created will need to be quality assured. These checks should be automated where possible, so the computer is doing the hard work, and to ensure their reliability.


The Statistics Development Team will provide generalised code that teams can use as a starting point for automated QA and they should run this as a minimum as part of their pipeline, they can then choose to add more area specific checks to the script and/or continue with current checking processes in tandem.


It is assumed that when using R, automated scripts will output html reports that the team can read through to understand their data and identify any issues.

### Recommended generic checks

# Data standards screening

---

The final part of quality assurance for underlying data files, will be to check that they meet the standards that have been agreed upon. Once teams have quality assured the data files, they can then run them through the data screener to check they meet the standards required for the EES platform. This forms the final part of the automated QA process. 


The screener outputs a .html report that we can read through to make sure all checks have passed. If any checks fail, teams should make the required changes to the data (potentially running full QA again) and then re-run the screener. If all the screener checks pass, and only if they all pass and the report shows 100%, the file is then ready to be loaded into the EES platform. 


The data-screener can found on [GitHub](https://github.com/dfe-analytical-services/ees-data-screener){target="_blank"}, and from there can be either downloaded or cloned. A [tutorial video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D60UU5r_TrM&feature=youtu.be){target="_blank"} has been made to walk you through the initial set-up and use of the project.

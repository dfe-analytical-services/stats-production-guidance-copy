# Routes for publishing

---

[Explore Education Statistics](https://explore-education-statistics.service.gov.uk/){target="_blank"} (EES) is the Department's new dissemination platform, designed to make DFE’s published statistics and data easier to find, access, use and understand. 

The platform moved into Public Beta in March 2020 and over the next year will operate in parallel with existing statistics pages on gov.uk as publications are moved to the new platform.

More information on why EES was introduced and the functionality within the platform can be found in these [slides.](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1CJMLxEPngGbTZbn1n4M6huGIeizUmjysthLwU3Zxoq4/edit?usp=sharing){target="_blank"}

The following table outlines the key differences between publishing via EES and the old method via [gov.uk:](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-education/about/statistics){target="_blank"}

| Previous service: Statistics collections on gov.uk | New service: Explore Education Statistics |
|:------|:------|
| Statisticians request pdf and excel files are uploaded to release pages on gov.uk | Statisticians load csv data files on to the service and use them to build release pages  |
| Release attachments are reviewed and approved via emails | Releases are reviewed and approved within the service |
| Release attachments are circulated for pre-release via email 24hours prior to publication date | Pre-release users are invited to preview releases within the service 24 hours prior to publication date |

**The EES platform consists of two applications:**

1. The public website, where users access stats

2. The admin website, where production teams create their stats.

<div class="alert alert-dismissible alert-info">
The admin side of EES is only supported in Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge. It will not work correctly in Internet Explorer. The public side does support Internet Explorer, though we still recommend that people use Chrome or Edge instead.
</div>

Both applications were initially released to Minimal Viable Product (MVP) standard, we will be iterating and improving the functionality based on user feedback throughout 2020 and 2021. 

Maintence and BAU running of the platform is supported by the Statistics Development Team.

<div class="alert alert-dismissible alert-warning">
If you are unsure which route to use for publication please contact the [HoP Office](mailto:Hop.STATISTICS@education.gov.uk).

# How to access EES

---

As stated above, EES consists of two parts. We also have four versions (environments) of EES, the banner for the admin part of each environment will inform you which environment you are on, this is also colour coded: 

- **Development** - Green - where changes are first merged in, and often the first time different pieces of work from different developers will interact properly

- **Test** - Pink - where our tester carries out manual testing of any new features to make sure things work as expected 

- **Pre-production** - Yellow - a sandbox area for admin champions and functionality testing

- **Production** - Red - the real service, anyone creating real releases that they intend to publish to the public should be using this environment


There is no overlap between the environments and content created on one cannot be moved to any other. We recommend that teams use the pre-production environment to familiarise themselves with the platform and test out what is possible, you can dummy publishing a publication to see what it will look like on the public website by following the process for publishing. Publications will go out at 8:30am on the scheduled day on pre-production, mirroring the way that production runs (though one hour earlier).

The core functionality across the environments is identical except for new changes, which are deployed through the different environments in order before they make it to production.

On the pre-production environment, all analysts have full permissions to create publications and releases, and see everything else that other analysts are making. This is unqiue to the pre-production environment, on the production environment analysts will only have access to releases that they have been granted specific access to.

<div class="alert alert-dismissible alert-info">
Please note that jobshare emails can not be used to access EES. Specific personal emails should be used instead, in the same way as you sign in to windows on your machine.
</div>

The Statistics Development Team will be responsible for setting up and maintaining user permissions during the beta phase. Change requests will be monitored via their main mailbox - explore.statistics@education.gov.uk. 

<div class="alert alert-dismissible alert-danger">
If you are bookmarking links, please be careful to bookmark the links below exactly as they are shown. Often when signing in you will be redirected via other url's as a part of the authentication process, and bookmarking those may lead to errors.
</div>

---

## Production environment

---

Admin - https://admin.explore-education-statistics.service.gov.uk/

Public - https://explore-education-statistics.service.gov.uk/

Access to the production admin service is limited to DfE AD accounts only and users have to have been invited to the service by either the Statistics Development Team (for full access) or an existing user (for pre-release access). Invites to the service are sent out via email using gov.uk Notify. 

To be invited to the service for full access teams need to email the [Statistics Development Team](mailto:explore.statistics@education.gov.uk), stating who needs access, what permissions they require (analyst or approver), and for which publications these apply. Approvers are traditionally DD's though sometimes this respsonsibility may be delegated. This email should be sent by the Team Leader, or accompanied with the relevant Team Leader’s approval. Once access has been granted you will recieve an email inviting you to use the platform.

At first we'll be inviting analysts to the admin site in phases, depending upon when they expect to first publish statistics via EES. This is so we can ensure we're providing sufficient support and have awareness of what releases are going out in the short term. 

---

## Pre-production environment

---

Admin pre-production - https://admin.pre-production.explore-education-statistics.service.gov.uk

Public pre-production - https://pre-production.explore-education-statistics.service.gov.uk

Analysts are able to test the service within the EES pre-production environment, and it is recommended that production teams start here until they are confident they know how they want to build their release for real (again, please contact the [Statistics Development Team](mailto:explore.statistics@education.gov.uk) to request access).

When accessing the pre-production environment you may be asked for a username and password, these are as follows: dfe, dataresearch.

<div class="alert alert-dismissible alert-danger">
Please note that the pre-production environment is not suitable for unpublished data. Unpublished data should only be uploaded to the production environment.
</div>

# Publication checklist

---

Before releasing statistics for the first time you may want to discuss the new process with key stakeholders and/or pre-release users to make them aware of the new service. You should also inform the [Statistics Development](mailto:explore.statistics@education.gov.uk) and [HoP Office](mailto:Hop.STATISTICS@education.gov.uk) teams.

Before you start creating a release in the platform you should have: 

* Announced the upcoming release via gov.uk
* Sent metadata form to HoP
* Contacted the BAU team so we can support you with your first release
* Produced your tidy csv data files with appropriate disclosure control
* Produced metadata files for each csv data file
* Ran your data and metadata through our screener checks

Before you publish a release you have created in the platform you should have: 

* Checked all the data has loaded successfully
* Written footnotes
* Written content (including tables and charts)
* Attached a public metadata document
* Created a public pre-release access list
* Ensured methodology information is either linked off to or attached to the release
* Passed the release for higher review (senior sign-off)
* Previewed your release
* Scheduled the release date
* Invited your PRA list to preview 24 hours before it goes live
* Raised a web ticket for the associated gov.uk page 

<div class="alert alert-dismissible alert-info">
Word templates for the external metadata, pra-list, and content can be found on [sharepoint](https://educationgovuk.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/sites/DfEStatisticsCoherence/Shared%20Documents/Templates%20-%20Explore%20Education%20Statistics?csf=1&e=7iJoUy){target="_blank"}.

## HoP Office - linking EES from .GOV.UK

---

You will need to arrange a GOV.UK statistics publication page so that it links to EES. Here is how to do that:

Two days ahead of publication, you’ll need to [raise a ticket with the Digital communications (GOV.UK) team](https://dfe.service-now.com/serviceportal?id=sc_cat_item&sys_id=1f40a44ddb50fa005ca2fddabf961922&sysparm_category=611828a6db6c2f403b929334ca9619f6&catalog_id=-1){target="_blank"} and ask them to **create a new GOV.UK statistics page with a link to EES, connect it to the announcement and add to any collections.**

In your request, you’ll need to include:

- title, summary sentence and ‘detail’ for the new page – you can include a link to previous releases if you want it to be the same

- the link for your EES release – if you don’t have it you can update the ticket when the link is available

- the link for the announcement

- the link of any GOV.UK collections it needs to be added to

- an email with clearance from your deputy director

- an email confirming communications are happy for it to go if it’s for stats that aren’t pre-announced or it’s an update to stats made after publication – so that they can prepare reactive lines

Here are examples of how the page will look like:

- [Primary School Performance Tables 2018](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/primary-school-performance-tables-2018){target="_blank"}

- [Higher Education Student Statistics 2018 to 2019](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/higher-education-student-statistics-2018-to-2019){target="_blank"}


<div class="alert alert-dismissible alert-info">
You can find what the link to your EES release will be by looking at the 'Public pre-release access list' page within the release release dashboard on EES.
</div>

`r knitr::include_graphics("images/EES-public-url.PNG")`

**Text to update the collection page:**

In addition, you will also need to [raise a ticket with the Digital communications (GOV.UK) team](https://dfe.service-now.com/serviceportal?id=sc_cat_item&sys_id=1f40a44ddb50fa005ca2fddabf961922&sysparm_category=611828a6db6c2f403b929334ca9619f6&catalog_id=-1){target="_blank"} to update your collection page/s with the following text:

> From [publication date], the Department for Education will be publishing the [publication title] on a new statistics site, [Explore Education Statistics (EES)](https://explore-education-statistics.service.gov.uk/){target="_blank"}.

When you raise the ticket please ensure that all the documents you submit are in an accesible format as stated in the [accessibility guidance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/make-your-website-or-app-accessible-and-publish-an-accessibility-statement){target="_blank"}. There is also [guidance on accessibility for Excel workbooks](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/file/FB7C7F72-90E9-496C-A4CB-318C53190BAC?tenantId=fad277c9-c60a-4da1-b5f3-b3b8b34a82f9&fileType=docx&objectUrl=https%3A%2F%2Feducationgovuk.sharepoint.com%2Fsites%2FDAN%2FShared%20Documents%2FGSS%2FAccessibility%20requirements%20for%20Excel%20workbooksstatistics.docx&baseUrl=https%3A%2F%2Feducationgovuk.sharepoint.com%2Fsites%2FDAN&serviceName=teams&threadId=19:3b1d045f4f2d4f8db7038a4c98acb299@thread.skype&groupId=6572094f-43a3-4537-bcf0-fc27dc6557ed){target="_blank"} in Teams.

# User engagement
<!-- keep this heading the same on this page, even if moved, as the self-assessment tool links from it -->

---


Being user centred is a key departmental priority. It is critical that we actively engage with the users of our statistics, and not just the ones who shout the loudest. There are thousands of users out there and teams should be actively be getting feedback on their publications from a variety of users - policy colleagues, local authorities, schools, media, and the general public to name but a few.

More information will follow here, though for now if you'd like assistance with this, please contact us.

# Re-publishing an old release on EES

---

To fill out the content on EES and help teams and users prepare for the transistion to the new platform we are asking teams to re-publish their latest releases (that were published via gov.uk) on EES where they are abe to. 

The main requirement to be able to do this is having your data prepared.

## Republishing checklist

---

If you have gone through the flowchart above and feel that you are ready to republish something on Explore Education Statistics, then we are here to help you do that. You have two options:

1. The [Statistics Development Team](mailto:explore.statistics@education.gov.uk) can mock up a first draft in the platform for you to then review and edit. For this to happen you'll need to send us the following:
   - Details of the release you want to republish
   - Underlying data files that have passed the screening checks
   - The link to the pdf commentary you previously published
   - The link to the methodology you previously published
   - Any other documents or information relating to the publication 

2. [Contact us](mailto:explore.statistics@education.gov.uk) for permission to access the production environment, telling us about the release you plan to republish, then build your release following the checklist below:
   * Run your data and metadata through our screener checks
   * Upload your data to your release on EES
   * Write footnotes
   * Create content (including tables and charts)
   * Attach a public metadata document
   * Ensure methodology information is either linked off to or attached to the release
   * Passed the release for higher review (senior sign-off)
   * Scheduled the release date

<div class="alert alert-dismissible alert-info">
Word templates for the external metadata, pra-list, and content can be found on [sharepoint](https://educationgovuk.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/sites/DfEStatisticsCoherence/Shared%20Documents/Templates%20-%20Explore%20Education%20Statistics?csf=1&e=7iJoUy){target="_blank"}.
 
If you're ready to recreate a previous gov.uk release on EES please email the [Statistics Development Team](mailto:explore.statistics@education.gov.uk).
